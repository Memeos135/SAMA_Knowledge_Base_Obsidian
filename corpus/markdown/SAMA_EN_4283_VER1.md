Minimum Capital Requirements for Counterparty Credit Risk and Credit 
Valuation Adjustment
1. Introduction
The Basel III framework on Counterparty Credit Risk includes a comprehensive, 
non-modelled approach for measuring counterparty credit risk arising from 
derivative contracts, Securities Financing transaction (SFT) and cash transactions 
in securities, foreign exchange and commodities. With the continued growth of 
the derivative market and banks’ increasing use of financial instruments and 
structured products for yield enhancement and/or risk management purposes, it 
is essential for them to have the necessary systems and expertise for managing 
any CCR associated with those activities.
This Framework covers both Counterparty Default Risk as well as the Credit 
Valuation Adjustment (CVA) to calculate the risk of losses arising from the 
changes in the value of the CVA in response to the changes in the counterparty 
credit spreads and market risk factors that drive prices of derivative transactions 
and SFTs. Banks that are below the CVA materiality threshold may opt not to 
calculate its CVA capital requirements. A bank must regularly review and update 
its materiality assessment to reflect any significant changes in materiality.
This framework is issued by SAMA in exercise of the authority vested in SAMA 
under the Central Bank Law issued via Royal Decree No. M/36 dated 
11/04/1442H, and the Banking Control Law issued 01/01/1386H.
This Framework supersedes any conflicting requirements in previous circulars in 
this regard (GDBC-371000101120, GDBC-410382700000, and GDBC-
361000021954).
2. Scope of Application
2.1. 
This framework applies to all domestic banks both on a consolidated basis, which 
include all branches and subsidiaries, and on a standalone basis.
2.2. 
This framework is not applicable to Foreign Banks Branches operating in the 
kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and the branches shall comply with the regulatory 
capital requirements stipulated by their respective home regulators.

3. Definitions
General Terms
The risk that the counterparty to a transaction could default 
before the final settlement of the transaction's cash flows. 
An economic loss would occur if the transactions or 
portfolio of transactions with the counterparty has a positive 
economic value at the time of default. Unlike a firm's 
exposure to credit risk through a loan, where the exposure 
to credit risk is unilateral and only the lending bank faces 
the risk of loss, CCR creates a bilateral risk of loss: the 
market value of the transaction can be positive or negative 
to either counterparty to the transaction. The market value 
is uncertain and can vary over time with the movement of 
underlying market factors.
Counterparty 
credit risk (CCR)
A central 
counterparty 
(CCP)
A 
clearing 
house 
that 
interposes 
itself 
between
counterparties to contracts traded in one or more financial 
markets, becoming the buyer to every seller and the seller 
to every buyer and thereby ensuring the future performance 
of open contracts. A CCP becomes counterparty to trades 
with market participants through novation, an open offer 
system, or another legally binding arrangement. For the 
purposes of the capital framework, a CCP is a financial 
institution.
A qualifying 
central 
counterparty 
(QCCP)
An entity that is licensed to operate as a CCP (including a 
license granted by way of confirming an exemption), and is 
permitted by the appropriate regulator/overseer Capital 
Market Authority (CMA) to operate as such with respect to 
the products offered. This is subject to the provision that the 
CCP is based and prudentially supervised in a jurisdiction 
where the relevant regulator/overseer has established.

that are consistent with the Principles for Financial Market 
Infrastructures issued by the Committee on Payments and 
Market Infrastructures and the International Organization 
of Securities Commissions.
4.1. 
1) Where the CCP is in a jurisdiction that does not have a 
CCP regulator applying the Principles to the CCP, then 
SAMA may make the determination of whether the CCP 
meets this definition.
4.2. 
2) In addition, for a CCP to be considered a QCCP, the 
requirements of 8.37 must be met to permit each clearing 
member bank to calculate its capital requirement for its 
default fund exposures.
4.3. 
A member of, or a direct participant in, a CCP that is 
entitled to enter into a transaction with the CCP, regardless 
of whether it enters into trades with a CCP for its own 
hedging, investment or speculative purposes or whether it 
also enters into trades as a financial intermediary between 
the CCP and other market participants.
A clearing 
member
For the purposes of the CCR standard, where a CCP has a 
link to a second CCP, that second CCP is to be treated as a 
clearing member of the first CCP. Whether the second 
CCP's collateral contribution to the first CCP is treated as 
initial margin or a default fund contribution will depend 
upon the legal arrangement between the CCPs. SAMA 
should be consulted to determine the treatment of this initial 
margin and default fund contributions.
A client is a party to a transaction with a CCP through either 
a clearing member acting as a financial intermediary, or a 
clearing member guaranteeing the performance of the client 
to the CCP.

A multi-level 
client structure
One in which banks can centrally clear as indirect clients; 
that is, when clearing services are provided to the bank by 
an institution which is not a direct clearing member, but is 
itself a client of a clearing member or another clearing 
client. For exposures between clients and clients of clients, 
we use the term higher level client for the institution 
providing clearing services; and the term lower level 
client for the institution clearing through that client.
Initial margin  
A clearing member's or client's funded collateral posted to 
the CCP to mitigate the potential future exposure (PFE) of 
the CCP to the clearing member arising from the possible 
future change in the value of their transactions. For the 
purposes of the calculation of counterparty credit risk 
capital requirements, initial margin does not include 
contributions to a CCP for mutualized loss sharing 
arrangements (i.e. in case a CCP uses initial margin to 
mutualize losses among the clearing members, it will be 
treated as a default fund exposure). Initial margin includes 
collateral deposited by a clearing member or client in excess 
of the minimum amount required, provided the CCP or 
clearing member may, in appropriate cases, prevent the 
clearing member or client from withdrawing such excess 
collateral.
Variation margin A clearing member's or client's funded collateral posted on
a daily or intraday basis to a CCP based upon price 
movements of their transactions.
Trade exposures  
As (in Chapter 8 of this framework), includes the current 
and potential future exposure of a clearing member or a 
client to a CCP arising from over-the-counter derivatives, 
exchange traded derivatives transactions or securities 
financing transactions, as well as initial margin. For the 
purposes of this definition, the current exposure of a

clearing member includes the variation margin due to the 
clearing member but not yet received.
Default funds  
Also known as clearing deposits or guaranty fund 
contributions (or any other names), are clearing members' 
funded or unfunded contributions towards, or underwriting 
of, a CCP's mutualized loss sharing arrangements. The 
description given by a CCP to its mutualized loss sharing 
arrangements is not determinative of their status as a default 
fund; rather, the substance of such arrangements will 
govern their status.
The transaction leg between the clearing member and the 
CCP when the clearing member acts on behalf of a client 
(e.g. when a clearing member clears or novates a client's 
trade).

Transaction types
Transactions where a counterparty undertakes to deliver a 
security, a commodity, or a foreign exchange amount 
against cash, other financial instruments, or commodities, 
or vice versa, at a settlement or delivery date that is 
contractually specified as more than the lower of the market 
standard for this particular instrument and five business 
days after the date on which the bank enters into the 
transaction.
Long settlement 
transactions
Transactions such as repurchase agreements, reverse 
repurchase agreements, security lending and borrowing, 
and margin lending transactions, where the value of the 
transactions depends on market valuations and the 
transactions are often subject to margin agreements.
Securities

Transactions in which a bank extends credit in connection 
with the purchase, sale, carrying or trading of securities.

happen to be secured by securities collateral. Generally, in 
margin lending transactions, the loan amount is 
collateralized by securities whose value is greater than the 
amount of the loan.
4.4. 
Netting sets, hedging sets, and related terms
Netting set  
A group of transactions with a single counterparty that are 
subject to a legally enforceable bilateral netting 
arrangement and for which netting is recognized for 
regulatory capital purposes under the provisions of 6.9 and 
6.10 that are applicable to the group of transactions, this 
framework text on credit risk mitigation techniques in credit 
risk mitigation techniques for exposures risk-weighted 
under the standardized approach of Basel III: Finalizing 
post-crisis reforms, or the cross product netting rules set out 
in 7.61 to 7.71. Each transaction that is not subject to a 
legally enforceable bilateral netting arrangement that is 
recognized for regulatory capital purposes should be 
interpreted as its own netting set for the purpose of these 
rules.
Hedging set 
A set of transactions within a single netting set within which 
full or partial offsetting is recognized for the purpose of 
calculating the PFE add-on of the Standardized Approach 
for counterparty credit risk.
A contractual agreement or provisions to an agreement 
under which one counterparty must supply variation margin 
to a second counterparty when an exposure of that second 
counterparty to the first counterparty exceeds a specified 
level.
Margin 
agreement
The largest amount of an exposure that remains outstanding 
until one party has the right to call for variation margin.

The time period from the last exchange of collateral 
covering a netting set of transactions with a defaulting 
counterparty until that counterparty is closed out and the 
resulting market risk is re-hedged.
Margin period of 
risk
Under the Internal Models Method for a netting set with 
maturity greater than one year is the ratio of the sum of 
expected exposure over the life of the transactions in a 
netting set discounted at the risk-free rate of return divided 
by the sum of expected exposure over one year in a netting 
set discounted at the risk-free rate. This effective maturity 
may be adjusted to reflect rollover risk by replacing 
expected exposure with effective expected exposure for 
forecasting horizons under one year. The formula is given 
in 7.20.
Effective 
maturity
Refers to the inclusion of transactions of different product 
categories within the same netting set pursuant to the cross-
product netting rules set out in in Chapter 7 of this 
framework.
Cross-product 
netting
Distributions
The forecast of the probability distribution of net market 
values of transactions within a netting set for some future 
date (the forecasting horizon) given the realized market 
value of those transactions up to the present time.
Distribution of 
market values
The forecast of the probability distribution of market values 
that is generated by setting forecast instances of negative 
net market values equal to zero (this takes account of the 
fact that, when the bank owes the counterparty money, the 
bank does not have an exposure to the counterparty).

Exposure measures and adjustments
Current exposure The larger of zero, or the current market value of a
transaction or portfolio of transactions within a netting set 
with a counterparty that would be lost upon the immediate 
default of the counterparty, assuming no recovery on the 
value of those transactions in bankruptcy. Current exposure 
is often also called Replacement Cost.
Peak exposure  
A high percentile (typically 95% or 99%) of the distribution 
of exposures at any particular future date before the 
maturity date of the longest transaction in the netting set. A 
peak exposure value is typically generated for many future 
dates up until the longest maturity date of transactions in the 
netting set.

transaction in the netting set matures. An expected exposure 
value is typically generated for many future dates up until 
the longest maturity date of transactions in the netting set.

be defined for a specific date as the greater of the expected 
exposure at that date, or the effective exposure at the

4. Implementation Timeline and SAMA Reporting Requirements
4.1. 
This framework will be effective on 01 January 2023.
4.2. 
SAMA expects all Banks to report the Counterparty credit risk (CCR) and Credit 
Valuation Adjustment (CVA)  Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA) and capital charge 
using SAMA’s Q17 reporting template within 30 days after the end of each 
quarter.
Minimum Capital Requirements for Counterparty Credit Risk (CCR)
5. Counterparty credit risk overview
Counterparty credit risk explanation
5.1. 
Counterparty credit risk is defined in Chapter 3 of this framework. It is the risk 
that the counterparty to a transaction could default before the final settlement of 
the transaction in cases where there is a bilateral risk of loss. The bilateral risk of 
loss is the key concept on which the definition of counterparty credit risk is based 
and is explained further below.

5.2. 
When a bank makes a loan to a borrower the credit risk exposure is unilateral. 
That is, the bank is exposed to the risk of loss arising from the default of the 
borrower, but the transaction does not expose the borrower to a risk of loss from 
the default of the bank. By contrast, some transactions give rise to a bilateral risk 
of loss and therefore give rise to a counterparty credit risk charge. For example:
(1) 
A bank makes a loan to a borrower and receives collateral from the
borrower.1
(a) The bank is exposed to the risk that the borrower defaults and the sale
of the collateral is insufficient to cover the loss on the loan.
(b) The borrower is exposed to the risk that the bank defaults and does not
return the collateral. Even in cases where the customer has the legal 
right to offset the amount it owes on the loan in compensation for the 
lost collateral, the customer is still exposed to the risk of loss at the 
outset of the loan because the value of the loan may be less than the 
value of the collateral the time of default of the bank.
(2) 
A bank borrows cash from a counterparty and posts collateral to the
counterparty (or undertakes a transaction that is economically equivalent, such as 
the sale and repurchase (repo) of a security).
(a) The bank is exposed to the risk that its counterparty defaults and does
not return the collateral that the bank posted.
(b) The counterparty is exposed to the risk that the bank defaults and the
amount the counterparty raises from the sale of the collateral that the 
bank posted is insufficient to cover the loss on the counterparty’s loan 
to the bank.
(1) 
A bank borrows a security from a counterparty and posts cash to the
counterparty as collateral (or undertakes a transaction that is economically 
equivalent, such as a reverse repo).
(a) The bank is exposed to the risk that its counterparty defaults and does
not return the cash that the bank posted as collateral.
(b) The counterparty is exposed to the risk that the bank defaults and the
cash that the bank posted as collateral is insufficient to cover the loss of 
the security that the bank borrowed.
1 The bilateral risk of loss in this example arises because the bank receives, i.e. takes possession of, 
the collateral as part of the transaction. By contrast, collateralized loans where the collateral is not 
exchanged prior to default, do not give rise to a bilateral risk of loss; for example a corporate or retail 
loan secured on a property of the borrower where the bank may only take possession of the property 
when the borrower defaults does not give rise to counterparty credit risk.

(2) 
A bank enters a derivatives transaction with a counterparty (e.g. it enters a
swap transaction or purchases an option). The value of the transaction can vary 
over time with the movement of underlying market factors.2
(a) The bank is exposed to the risk that the counterparty defaults when the
derivative has a positive value for the bank.
(b) The counterparty is exposed to the risk that the bank defaults when the
derivative has a positive value for the counterparty.
Scope of counterparty credit risk charge
5.3. 
Banks must calculate a counterparty credit risk charge for all exposures that give 
rise to counterparty credit risk, with the exception of those transactions listed in 
5.15 below. The categories of transaction that give rise to counterparty credit risk 
are:
(1) 
Over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives
(2) 
Exchange-traded derivatives
(3) 
Long settlement transactions
(4) 
Securities financing transactions
5.4. 
The transactions listed in 5.3 above generally exhibit the following abstract 
characteristics:
(1) 
The transactions generate a current exposure or market value.
(2) 
The transactions have an associated random future market value based on
market variables. 
(3) 
The transactions generate an exchange of payments or an exchange of a
financial instrument (including commodities) against payment.  
(4) 
The transactions are undertaken with an identified counterparty against
which a unique probability of default can be determined.
5.5. 
Other common characteristics of the transactions listed in 5.3 include the 
following:
2 The counterparty credit risk rules capture the risk of loss to the bank from the default of the 
derivative counterparty. The risk of gains or losses on the changing market value of the derivative is 
captured by the market risk framework. The market risk framework captures the risk that the bank 
will suffer a loss as a result of market movements in underlying risk factors referenced by the 
derivative (e.g. interest rates for an interest rate swap); however, it also captures the risk of losses that 
can result from the derivative declining in value due to a deterioration in the creditworthiness of the 
derivative counterparty. The latter risk is the credit valuation adjustment risk set out in Chapter 11 of 
this Framework.

(1) 
Collateral may be used to mitigate risk exposure and is inherent in the
nature of some transactions.  
(2) 
Short-term financing may be a primary objective in that the transactions
mostly consist of an exchange of one asset for another (cash or securities) for a 
relatively short period of time, usually for the business purpose of financing. The 
two sides of the transactions are not the result of separate decisions but form an 
indivisible whole to accomplish a defined objective.  
(1) 
Netting may be used to mitigate the risk.
(2) 
Positions are frequently valued (most commonly on a daily basis),
according to market variables.  
(3) 
Remargining may be employed.
Methods to calculate counterparty credit risk exposure
5.6. 
For the transaction types listed in 5.3 above, banks must calculate their 
counterparty credit risk exposure, or exposure at default (EAD),3 using one of the 
methods set out in 5.7 to 5.8 below. The methods vary according to the type of 
the transaction, the counterparty to the transaction, and whether the bank has 
received SAMA approval to use the method (if such approval is required).
5.7. 
For exposures that are not cleared through a central counterparty (CCP) the 
following methods must be used to calculate the counterparty credit risk 
exposure:
(1) 
Standardized approach for measuring counterparty credit risk exposures
(SACCR), which is set out in Chapter 6 of this framework. This method is to be 
used for exposures arising from OTC derivatives, exchange-traded derivatives 
and long settlement transactions. This method must be used if the bank does not 
have approval to use the internal models method (IMM).  
(2) 
The simple approach or comprehensive approach to the recognition of
collateral, which are both set out in the credit risk mitigation chapter of the 
standardized approach to credit risk (see Chapter 9 on the mitigation techniques 
for exposures risk-weighted under the standardized approach of the Minimum

3 The terms “exposure” and “EAD” are used interchangeable in the counterparty credit risk chapters 
of the credit risk standard. This reflects the fact that the amounts calculated under the counterparty 
credit risk rules must typically be used as either the “exposure” within the standardized approach to 
credit risk, or the EAD within the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach to credit risk, as described in 
5.12.

securities financing transactions (SFTs) and must be used if the bank does not 
have approval to use the IMM.  
(3) 
The value-at-risk (VaR) models approach, which is set out in paragraphs
73-76 of Chapter 9 of the Minimum Capital Requirements for Credit Risk. For 
banks applying the IRB approach to credit risk, the VaR models approach may 
be used to calculate EAD for SFTs, subject to SAMA approval, as an alternative 
to the method set out in (2) above.  
(4) 
The IMM, which is set out in Chapter 7 of this framework. This method
may be used, subject to SAMA approval, as an alternative to the methods to 
calculate counterparty credit risk exposures set out in (1) and (2) above (for all of 
the exposures referenced in those bullets).
5.8. 
For exposures that are cleared through a CCP, banks must apply the method set 
out Chapter 8 of this framework. This method covers:
(1) 
the exposures of a bank to a CCPs when the bank is a clearing member of
the CCP;  
(2) 
the exposures of a bank to its clients, when the bank is a clearing members
and act as an intermediary between the client and the CCP; and  
(3) 
the exposures of a bank to a clearing member of a CCP, when the bank is
a client of the clearing member and the clearing member is acting as an 
intermediary between the bank and the CCP.
5.9. 
Exposures to central counterparties arising from the settlement of cash 
transactions (equities, fixed income, spot foreign exchange and spot 
commodities), are excluded from the requirements of Chapter 8 of this 
framework. They are instead subject to the requirements of chapter 25 of the 
Minimum Capital Requirements for Credit Risk.
5.10. Under the methods outlined above, the exposure amount or EAD for a given
counterparty is equal to the sum of the exposure amounts or EADs calculated for 
each netting set with that counterparty, subject to the exception outlined in 5.11 
below.
5.11. The exposure or EAD for a given OTC derivative counterparty is defined as the
greater of zero and the difference between the sum of EADs across all netting sets 
with the counterparty and the credit valuation adjustment (CVA) for that 
counterparty which has already been recognized by the bank as an incurred write-
down (i.e. a CVA loss). This CVA loss is calculated without taking into account 
any offsetting debit valuation adjustments, which have been deducted from

capital under the Regulatory Adjustments or “Filter” chapter of Section A of 
SAMA's Final Guidance Document Concerning Implementation of Capital 
Reforms Under Basel III Framework4. This reduction of EAD by incurred CVA 
losses does not apply to the determination of the CVA risk capital requirement.
Methods to calculate CCR risk-weighted assets
5.12. After banks have calculated their counterparty credit risk exposures, or EAD,
according to the methods outlined above, they must apply the standardized 
approach to credit risk, the IRB approach to credit risk, or, in the case of the 
exposures to CCPs, the capital requirements set out in Chapter 8 of this 
framework. For counterparties to which the bank applies the standardized 
approach, the counterparty credit risk exposure amount will be risk weighted 
according to the relevant risk weight of the counterparty. For counterparties to 
which the bank applies the IRB approach, the counterparty credit risk exposure 
amount defines the EAD that is used within the IRB approach to determine risk-
weighted assets (RWA) and expected loss amounts.
5.13. For IRB exposures, the risk weights applied to OTC derivative exposures should
be calculated with the full maturity adjustment (as defined in paragraph 6 of 
chapter 11 of the Minimum Capital Requirements for Credit Risk) capped at 1 
for each netting set for which the bank calculates CVA capital under either the 
basic approach (BA-CVA) or the standardized approach (SA-CVA), as provided 
in 11.12.
5.14. For banks that have SAMA approval to use IMM, RWA for credit risk must be
calculated as the higher of:
(1) 
the sum of RWA calculated using Internal Models Method (IMM) with
current parameter calibrations; and  
(2) 
the sum of RWA calculated using IMM with stressed parameter
calibrations.

Exemptions
5.15. As an exception to the requirements of 5.3 above, banks are not required to
calculate a counterparty credit risk charge for the following types of transactions 
(i.e. the exposure amount or EAD for counterparty credit risk for the transaction 
will be zero):
(1) 
Credit derivative protection purchased by the bank against a banking book
exposure, or against a counterparty credit risk exposure. In such cases, the bank 
will determine its capital requirement for the hedged exposure according to the 
criteria and general rules for the recognition of credit derivatives within the 
standardized approach or IRB approach to credit risk (i.e. substitution approach).  
(2) 
Sold credit default swaps in the banking book where they are treated in the
framework as a guarantee provided by the bank and subject to a credit risk charge 
for the full notional amount.
Minimum haircut floors for securities financing transactions (SFTs)
5.16. Chapter 10 of this framework specifies the treatment of certain non-centrally
cleared SFTs with certain counterparties (in-scope SFTs). The requirements are 
applicable to banks in jurisdictions that are permitted to conduct in-scope SFTs 
below the minimum haircut floors specified within Chapter 10 of this framework.
6. Standardized approach to counterparty credit risk
Overview and scope
6.1. 
The Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk (SA-CCR) applies to 
over the-counter (OTC) derivatives, exchange-traded derivatives and long 
settlement transactions.5  Banks that do not have approval to apply the internal 
model method (IMM) for the relevant transactions must use SA-CCR, as set out 
in this chapter.
6.2. 
EAD is to be calculated separately for each netting set (as set out in 4.14 , each 
transaction that is not subject to a legally enforceable bilateral netting 
arrangement that is recognized for regulatory capital purposes should be

interpreted as its own netting set).6 It is determined using the following formula, 
where:
(1) 
alpha = 1.4
(2) 
RC = the replacement cost calculated according to 6.5 to 6.21
(3) 
PFE = the amount for potential future exposure calculated according to
6.22 to 6.79
𝐴�𝐴𝐴� = 𝑎𝑘�𝑘�ℎ𝑎 ∗ (𝑅𝐴� + 𝑀�𝐴�𝐴�)
6.3. 
For credit derivatives where the bank is the protection seller and that are outside 
netting and margin agreements, the EAD may be capped to the amount of unpaid 
premia. Banks have the option to remove such credit derivatives from their legal 
netting sets and treat them as individual unmargined transactions in order to apply 
the cap.
6.4. 
The replacement cost (RC) and the potential future exposure (PFE) components 
are calculated differently for margined and unmargined netting sets. Margined 
netting sets are netting sets covered by a margin agreement under which the 
bank’s counterparty has to post variation margin; all other netting sets, including 
those covered by a one-way margin agreement where only the bank posts 
variation margin, are treated as unmargined for the purposes of the SA-CCR. The 
EAD for a margined netting set is capped at the EAD of the same netting set 
calculated on an unmargined basis.
Replacement Cost and Net Independent Collateral Amount
6.5. 
For unmargined transactions, the RC intends to capture the loss that would occur 
if a counterparty were to default and were closed out of its transactions 
immediately. The PFE add-on represents a potential conservative increase in 
exposure over a one-year time horizon from the present date (i.e. the calculation 
date).
6.6. 
For margined trades, the RC intends to capture the loss that would occur if a 
counterparty were to default at the present or at a future time, assuming that the 
closeout and replacement of transactions occur instantaneously. However, there 
may be a period (the margin period of risk) between the last exchange of collateral 
before default and replacement of the trades in the market. The PFE add-on 
represents the potential change in value of the trades during this time period.
6 The EAD can be set to zero only for sold options that are outside netting and margin agreements.

6.7. 
In both cases, the haircut applicable to noncash collateral in the replacement cost 
formulation represents the potential change in value of the collateral during the 
appropriate time period (one year for unmargined trades and the margin period of 
risk for margined trades).
6.8. 
Replacement cost is calculated at the netting set level, whereas PFE add-ons are 
calculated for each asset class within a given netting set and then aggregated (see 
6.26 to 6.79 below).
6.9. 
For capital adequacy purposes, banks may net transactions (e.g. when 
determining the RC component of a netting set) subject to novation under which 
any obligation between a bank and its counterparty to deliver a given currency on 
a given value date is automatically amalgamated with all other obligations for the 
same currency and value date, legally substituting one single amount for the 
previous gross obligations. Banks may also net transactions subject to any legally 
valid form of bilateral netting not covered in the preceding sentence, including 
other forms of novation. In every such case where netting is applied, a bank must 
satisfy SAMA that it has:
(1) 
A netting contract with the counterparty or other agreement which creates
a single legal obligation, covering all included transactions, such that the bank 
would have either a claim to receive or obligation to pay only the net sum of the 
positive and negative mark-to-market values of included individual transactions 
in the event a counterparty fails to perform due to any of the following: default, 
bankruptcy, liquidation or similar circumstances.7 
(2) 
Written and reasoned legal reviews that, in the event of a legal challenge,
the relevant courts and administrative authorities would find the bank’s exposure 
to be such a net amount under:  
(3) 
The law of the jurisdiction in which the counterparty is chartered and, if
the foreign branch of a counterparty is involved, then also under the law of the 
jurisdiction in which the branch is located;
(a) The law that governs the individual transactions; and  
(b) The law that governs any contract or agreement necessary to effect the
netting.
7 The netting contract must not contain any clause which, in the event of default of a counterparty, 
permits a non-defaulting counterparty to make limited payments only, or no payments at all, to the 
estate of the defaulting party, even if the defaulting party is a net creditor.

Procedures in place to ensure that the legal characteristics of netting
arrangements are kept under review in light of the possible changes in relevant 
law.
6.10. SAMA, after consultation when necessary with other relevant supervisors, must
be satisfied that the netting is enforceable under the laws of each of the relevant 
jurisdictions. Thus, if any of these supervisors is dissatisfied about enforceability 
under its laws, the netting contract or agreement will not meet this condition and 
neither counterparty could obtain supervisory benefit.
6.11. There are two formulations of replacement cost depending on whether the trades
with a counterparty are margined or unmargined. The margined formulation 
could apply both to bilateral transactions and to central clearing relationships. The 
formulation also addresses the various arrangements that a bank may have to post 
and/or receive collateral that may be referred to as initial margin.
Formulation for unmargined transactions
6.12. For unmargined transactions, RC is defined as the greater of:
(i) 
the current market value of the derivative contracts less net haircut 
collateral held by the bank (if any), and
(ii) 
zero. This is consistent with the use of replacement cost as the measure 
of current exposure, meaning that when the bank owes the counterparty 
money it has no exposure to the counterparty if it can instantly replace 
its trades and sell collateral at current market prices.8
The formula for RC is as follows, where:
(1) 
V is the value of the derivative transactions in the netting set
(2) 
C is the haircut value of net collateral held, which is calculated in
accordance with the net independent collateral amount (NICA) methodology 
defined in 6.19.9
8 The haircut applicable in the replacement cost calculation for unmargined trades should follow the 
formula in paragraphs 62 of chapter 9 of the Minimum Capital Requirements for Credit Risk. In 
applying the formula, banks must use the maturity of the longest transaction in the netting set as the 
value for N , capped at 250 days, in order to R scale haircuts for unmargined trades, which is capped 
at 100%. 
9 As set out in 6.4, netting sets that include a one-way margin agreement in favor of the bank’s 
counterparty (i.e. the bank posts, but does not receive variation margin) are treated as unmargined for 
the purposes of SA-CCR. For such netting sets, C also includes, with a negative sign, the variation 
margin amount posted by the bank to the counterparty.

𝑅𝐴� = max⁡{𝑉 − 𝐴�; 0}
6.13. For the purpose of 6.12 above, the value of non-cash collateral posted by the bank
to its counterparty is increased and the value of the non-cash collateral received 
by the bank from its counterparty is decreased using haircuts (which are the same 
as those that apply to repo-style transactions) for the time periods described in 
6.7above.
6.14. The formulation set out in 6.12 above, does not permit the replacement cost,
which represents today’s exposure to the counterparty, to be less than zero. 
However, banks sometimes hold excess collateral (even in the absence of a 
margin agreement) or have out-of-the-money trades which can further protect the 
bank from the increase of the exposure. As discussed in 6.23 to 6.25 below, the 
SA-CCR allows such over-collateralization and negative mark-to market value to 
reduce PFE, but they are not permitted to reduce replacement cost.
Formulation for margined transactions
6.15. The RC formula for margined transactions builds on the RC formula for
unmargined transactions. It also employs concepts used in standard margining 
agreements, as discussed more fully below.
6.16. The RC for margined transactions in the SA-CCR is defined as the greatest
exposure that would not trigger a call for VM, taking into account the mechanics 
of collateral exchanges in margining agreements.10 Such mechanics include, for 
example, “Threshold”, “Minimum Transfer Amount” and “Independent 
Amount” in the standard industry documentation,11 which are factored into a call 
for VM.12 A defined, generic formulation has been created to reflect the variety 
of margining approaches used and those being considered by supervisors 
internationally.
10 See chapter 12 and Chapter 13 of this framework for illustrative examples of the effect of standard 
margin agreements on the SA-CCR formulation. 
11 For example, the 1992 (Multicurrency-Cross Border) Master Agreement and the 2002 Master 
Agreement published by the International Swaps & Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA Master 
Agreement). The ISDA Master Agreement includes the ISDA Credit Support Annexes: the 1994 
Credit Support Annex (Security Interest – New York Law), or, as applicable, the 1995 Credit Support 
Annex (Transfer – English Law) and the 1995 Credit Support Deed (Security Interest – English Law). 
12 For example, in the ISDA Master Agreement, the term “Credit Support Amount”, or the overall 
amount of collateral that must be delivered between the parties, is defined as the greater of the 
Secured Party’s Exposure plus the aggregate of all Independent Amounts applicable to the Pledgor 
minus all Independent Amounts applicable to the Secured Party, minus the Pledgor’s Threshold and 
zero.

Incorporating NICA into replacement cost
6.17. One objective of the SA-CCR is to reflect the effect of margining agreements and
the associated exchange of collateral in the calculation of CCR exposures. The 
following paragraphs address how the exchange of collateral is incorporated into 
the SA-CCR.
6.18. To avoid confusion surrounding the use of terms initial margin and independent
amount which are used in various contexts and sometimes interchangeably, the 
term independent collateral amount (ICA) is introduced. ICA represents:
(i) 
collateral (other than VM) posted by the counterparty that the bank may 
seize upon default of the counterparty, the amount of which does not 
change in response to the value of the transactions it secures and/or
(ii) 
the Independent Amount (IA) parameter as defined in standard industry 
documentation. ICA can change in response to factors such as the value 
of the collateral or a change in the number of transactions in the netting 
set.
6.19. Because both a bank and its counterparty may be required to post ICA, it is
necessary to introduce a companion term, net independent collateral amount 
(NICA), to describe the amount of collateral that a bank may use to offset its 
exposure on the default of the counterparty. NICA does not include collateral that 
a bank has posted to a segregated, bankruptcy remote account, which presumably 
would be returned upon the bankruptcy of the counterparty. That is, NICA 
represents any collateral (segregated or unsegregated) posted by the counterparty 
less the unsegregated collateral posted by the bank. With respect to IA, NICA 
takes into account the differential of IA required for the bank minus IA required 
for the counterparty.
6.20. For margined trades, the replacement cost is calculated using the following
formula, where:
(1) 
V and C are defined as in the unmargined formulation, except that C now
includes the net variation margin amount, where the amount received by the bank 
is accounted with a positive sign and the amount posted by the bank is accounted 
with a negative sign  
(2) 
TH is the positive threshold before the counterparty must send the bank
collateral  
(3) 
MTA is the minimum transfer amount applicable to the counterparty

𝑅𝐴� = max⁡{𝑉 − 𝐴�; 𝑅�𝐻 + 𝑀𝑅�𝐴 − 𝑀�𝐻�𝐴�𝐴; 0}
6.21. TH + MTA – NICA represents the largest exposure that would not trigger a VM
call and it contains levels of collateral that need always to be maintained. For 
example, without initial margin or IA, the greatest exposure that would not trigger 
a variation margin call is the threshold plus any minimum transfer amount. In the 
adapted formulation, NICA is subtracted from TH + MTA. This makes the 
calculation more accurate by fully reflecting both the actual level of exposure that 
would not trigger a margin call and the effect of collateral held and /or posted by 
a bank. The calculation is floored at zero, recognizing that the bank may hold 
NICA in excess of TH + MTA, which could otherwise result in a negative 
replacement cost.
PFE add-on for each netting set
6.22. The PFE add-on consists of:
(i) 
an aggregate add-on component; and
(ii) 
a multiplier that allows for the recognition of excess collateral or 
negative mark-to-market value for the transactions within the netting 
set. The formula for PFE is as follows, where:
(1) 
AddOnaggregate⁡is the aggregate add-on component (see 6.27 below)
(2) 
multiplier is defined as a function of three inputs: V, C and AddOnaggregate
𝑀�𝐴�𝐴� = 𝑘�𝑟�𝑘�𝑟�𝑖𝑘�𝑘�𝑖𝑐�𝑟 ∗ AddOnaggregate
Multiplier (recognition of excess collateral and negative mark-to-market)
6.23. As a general principle, over-collateralization should reduce capital requirements
for counterparty credit risk. In fact, many banks hold excess collateral (i.e. 
collateral greater than the net market value of the derivatives contracts) precisely 
to offset potential increases in exposure represented by the add-on. As discussed 
in 6.12 and 6.20, collateral may reduce the replacement cost component of the 
exposure under the SA-CCR. The PFE component also reflects the risk-reducing 
property of excess collateral.
6.24. Banks should apply a multiplier to the PFE component that decreases as excess
collateral increases, without reaching zero (the multiplier is floored at 5% of the 
PFE add-on). When the collateral held is less than the net market value of the 
derivative contracts (“under-collateralization”), the current replacement cost is 
positive and the multiplier is equal to one (i.e. the PFE component is equal to the

full value of the aggregate add-on). Where the collateral held is greater than the 
net market value of the derivative contracts (“over-collateralization”), the current 
replacement cost is zero and the multiplier is less than one (i.e. the PFE 
component is less than the full value of the aggregate add-on).
6.25. This multiplier will also be activated when the current value of the derivative
transactions is negative. This is because out-of-the-money transactions do not 
currently represent an exposure and have less chance to go in-the-money. The 
formula for the multiplier is as follows, where:
(1) 
exp(…) is the exponential function
(2) 
Floor is 5%
(3) 
V is the value of the derivative transactions in the netting set
(4) 
C is the haircut value of net collateral held

𝑉 − 𝐴�
2 ∗ (1 − 𝐴�𝑘�𝑘�𝑘�𝑟) ∗ 𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝑎𝑎�𝑎�𝑘�𝑎�𝑎�𝑎𝑘�𝑎�)}
Aggregate add-on and asset classes
6.26. To calculate the aggregate add-on, banks must calculate add-ons for each asset
class within the netting set. The SA-CCR uses the following five asset classes:
(1) 
Interest rate derivatives
(2) 
Foreign exchange derivatives
(3) 
Credit derivatives
(4) 
Equity derivatives.
(5) 
Commodity derivatives
6.27. Diversification benefits across asset classes are not recognized. Instead, the
respective add-ons for each asset class are simply aggregated using the following 
formula (where the sum is across the asset classes):
𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝑎𝑎�𝑎�𝑘�𝑎�𝑎�𝑎𝑘�𝑎� =
∑
𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝑎𝑘�𝑘�𝑎�𝑘�𝑎�𝑘�𝑎𝑘�𝑘�

Allocation of derivative transactions to one or more asset classes
6.28. The designation of a derivative transaction to an asset class is to be made on the
basis of its primary risk driver. Most derivative transactions have one primary

risk driver, defined by its reference underlying instrument (e.g. an interest rate 
curve for an interest rate swap, a reference entity for a credit default swap, a 
foreign exchange rate for a foreign exchange (FX) call option, etc.). When this 
primary risk driver is clearly identifiable, the transaction will fall into one of the 
asset classes described above.
6.29. For more complex trades that may have more than one risk driver (e.g. multi-
asset or hybrid derivatives), banks must take sensitivities and volatility of the 
underlying into account for determining the primary risk driver
6.30. SAMA may also require more complex trades to be allocated to more than one
asset class, resulting in the same position being included in multiple classes. In 
this case, for each asset class to which the position is allocated, banks must 
determine appropriately the sign and delta adjustment of the relevant risk driver 
(the role of delta adjustments in SA-CCR is outlined further in 6.32 below).
General steps for calculating the PFE add-on for each asset class
6.31. For each transaction, the primary risk factor or factors need to be determined and
attributed to one or more of the five asset classes: interest rate, foreign exchange, 
credit, equity or commodity. The add-on for each asset class is calculated using 
asset-class-specific formulas.13
6.32. Although the formulas for the asset class add-ons vary between asset classes, they
all use the following general steps:
(6) 
The effective notional (D) must be calculated for each derivative (i.e. each
individual trade) in the netting set. The effective notional is a measure of the 
sensitivity of the trade to movements in underlying risk factors (i.e. interest rates, 
exchange rates, credit spreads, equity prices and commodity prices). The effective 
notional is calculated as the product of the following parameters (i.e. D = d * MF 
* δ):
(a) The adjusted notional (d). The adjusted notional is a measure of the
size of the trade. For derivatives in the foreign exchange asset class this
13 The formulas for calculating the asset class add-ons represent stylized Effective EPE calculations 
under the assumption that all trades in the asset class have zero current mark-to-market value (i.e. they 
are at-the-money).

is simply the notional value of the foreign currency leg of the derivative 
contract, converted to the Saudi Riyal (SAR). For derivatives in the 
equity and commodity asset classes, it is simply the current price of the 
relevant share or unit of commodity multiplied by the number of shares 
/units that the derivative references. For derivatives in the interest rate 
and credit asset classes, the notional amount is adjusted by a measure 
of the duration of the instrument to account for the fact that the value of 
instruments with longer durations are more sensitive to movements in 
underlying risk factors (i.e. interest rates and credit spreads).
(b) The maturity factor (MF). The maturity factor is a parameter that takes
account of the time period over which the potential future exposure is 
calculated. The calculation of the maturity factor varies depending on 
whether the netting set is margined or unmargined.
(c) The supervisory delta (δ). The supervisory delta is used to ensure that
the effective notional take into account the direction of the trade, i.e. 
whether the trade is long or short, by having a positive or negative sign. 
It is also takes into account whether the trade has a non-linear 
relationship with the underlying risk factor (which is the case for 
options and collateralized debt obligation tranches).
(7) A supervisory factor (SF) is identified for each individual trade in the netting
set. The supervisory factor is the supervisory specified change in value of the 
underlying risk factor on which the potential future exposure calculation is based, 
which has been calibrated to take into account the volatility of underlying risk 
factors.
(8) The trades within each asset class are separated into supervisory specified
hedging sets. The purpose of the hedging sets is to group together trades within 
the netting set where long and short positions should be permitted to offset each 
other in the calculation of potential future exposure.
(9) Aggregation formulas are applied to aggregate the effective notionals and
supervisory factors across all trades within each hedging set and finally at the 
asset-class level to give the asset class level add-on. The method of aggregation 
varies between asset classes and for credit, equity and commodity derivatives it 
also involves the application of supervisory correlation parameters to capture 
diversification of trades and basis risk.

6.33. There are four time period parameters that are used in the SA-CCR (all expressed
in years):
(1) For all asset classes, the maturity 𝑀𝑖 of a contract is the time period (starting
today) until the latest day when the contract may still be active. This time period 
appears in the maturity factor defined in 6.51 to 6.56 that scales down the adjusted 
notionals for unmargined trades for all asset classes. If a derivative contract has 
another derivative contract as its underlying (for example, a swaption) and may 
be physically exercised into the underlying contract (i.e. a bank would assume a 
position in the underlying contract in the event of exercise), then maturity of the 
contract is the time period until the final settlement date of the underlying 
derivative contract.
(2) For interest rate and credit derivatives, 𝑅�𝑖 is the period of time (starting today)
until start of the time period referenced by an interest rate or credit contract. If 
the derivative references the value of another interest rate or credit instrument 
(e.g. swaption or bond option), the time period must be determined on the basis 
of the underlying instrument. 𝑅�𝑖 appears in the definition of supervisory duration 
defined in 6.36.
(3) For interest rate and credit derivatives, 𝐴�𝑖 is the period of time (starting today)
until the end of the time period referenced by an interest rate or credit contract. If 
the derivative references the value of another interest rate or credit instrument 
(e.g. swaption or bond option), the time period must be determined on the basis 
of the underlying instrument. 𝐴�𝑖 appears in the definition of supervisory duration 
defined in 6.36. In addition, 𝐴�𝑖 is used for allocating derivatives in the interest 
rate asset class to maturity buckets, which are used in the calculation of the asset 
class add-on (see 6.60(3)).
(4) For options in all asset classes, 𝑅�𝑖 is the time period (starting today) until the latest
contractual exercise date as referenced by the contract. This period shall be used 
for the determination of the option’s supervisory delta in 6.40 to 6.43.
6.34. Table 1 includes example transactions and provides each transaction’s related
maturity 𝑀𝑖, start date 𝑅�𝑖 and end date 𝐴�𝑖. In addition, the option delta in 6.40 to 
6.43 depends on the latest contractual exercise date 𝑅�𝑖 (not separately shown in 
the table).

Trade-level adjusted notional (for trade i): 𝑐�𝑖
6.35. The adjusted notionals are defined at the trade level and take into account both
the size of a position and its maturity dependency, if any.
6.36. For interest rate and credit derivatives, the trade-level adjusted notional is the
product of the trade notional amount, converted to the Saudi Riyal (SAR), and 
the supervisory duration SD, which is given by the formula below (i.e.𝑐�𝑖 =

𝑘�𝑘�𝑟�𝑖𝑘�𝑘�𝑎𝑘� ∗ 𝑅�𝐴�𝑖). The calculated value of 𝑅�𝐴�𝑖 is floored at ten business days.14 If 
the start date has occurred (e.g. an ongoing interest rate swap), 𝑅�𝑖 must be set to 
zero.
𝑅�𝐴�𝑖 = exp(−0.05 ∗ 𝑅�𝑖) − exp⁡(−0.05 ∗ 𝐴�𝑖)
0.05
6.37. For foreign exchange derivatives, the adjusted notional is defined as the notional
of the foreign currency leg of the contract, converted to the Saudi Riyal (SAR). 
If both legs of a foreign exchange derivative are denominated in currencies other 
than the Saudi Riyal (SAR), the notional amount of each leg is converted to the 
Saudi Riyal (SAR) and the leg with the larger Saudi Riyal (SAR) value is the 
adjusted notional amount.
6.38. For equity and commodity derivatives, the adjusted notional is defined as the
product of the current price of one unit of the stock or commodity (e.g. a share of 
equity or barrel of oil) and the number of units referenced by the trade.
6.39. In many cases the trade notional amount is stated clearly and fixed until maturity.
When this is not the case, banks must use the following rules to determine the 
trade notional amount.
(1) Where the notional is a formula of market values, the bank must enter the current
market values to determine the trade notional amount.
(2) For all interest rate and credit derivatives with variable notional amounts
specified in the contract (such as amortizing and accreting swaps), banks must 
use the average notional over the remaining life of the derivative as the trade 
notional amount. The average should be calculated as “time weighted”. The 
averaging described in this paragraph does not cover transactions where the 
notional varies due to price changes (typically, FX, equity and commodity 
derivatives).
(3) Leveraged swaps must be converted to the notional of the equivalent unleveraged
swap, that is, where all rates in a swap are multiplied by a factor, the stated 
notional must be multiplied by the factor on the interest rates to determine the 
trade notional amount.
14 Note there is a distinction between the time period of the underlying transaction and the remaining 
maturity of the derivative contract. For example, a European interest rate swaption with expiry of 1 
year and the term of the underlying swap of 5 years has S = 1 year and E = 6 i years.

(4) For a derivative contract with multiple exchanges of principal, the notional is
multiplied by the number of exchanges of principal in the derivative contract to 
determine the trade notional amount.
(5) For a derivative contract that is structured such that on specified dates any
outstanding exposure is settled and the terms are reset so that the fair value of the 
contract is zero, the remaining maturity equals the time until the next reset date.
Supervisory delta adjustment
6.40. The supervisory delta adjustment (𝛼�𝑖) parameters are also defined at the trade i
level and are applied to the adjusted notional amounts to reflect the direction of 
the transaction and its non-linearity.15
6.41. The delta adjustments for all instruments that are not options and are not
collateralized debt obligation (CDO) tranches are as set out in the table below:16
Short in the primary risk
𝛼�𝑖 
Long in the primary risk

Instruments that are not 
options or CDO tranches
6.42. The delta adjustments for options are set out in the table below, where:
(1) The following are parameters that banks must determine appropriately:
(a) 𝑀�𝑖: Underlying price (spot, forward, average, etc.)   
(b) 𝐾𝑖: Strike price  
(c) 𝑅�𝑖 : Latest contractual exercise date of the option
(2) The supervisory volatility 𝜎𝑖 an option is specified on the basis of supervisory
factor applicable to the trade (see Table 2 in 6.75).
(3) The symbol Φ represents the standard normal cumulative distribution function.
𝛼�𝑖 
Bought 
Sold
15 Whenever appropriate, the forward (rather than spot) value of the underlying in the supervisory 
delta adjustments formula should be used in order to account for the risk-free rate as well as for 
possible cash flows prior to the option expiry (such as dividends). 
16 “Long in the primary risk factor” means that the market value of the instrument increases when the 
value of the primary risk factor increases. “Short in the primary risk factor” means that the market 
value of the instrument decreases when the value of the primary risk factor increases.

Effective notional for options
6.44. For single-payment options the effective notional (i.e. 𝐴� = 𝑐� ∗ 𝑀𝐴� ∗ 𝛼�) is
calculated using the following specifications:
17 First-to-default, second-to-default and subsequent-to-default credit derivative transactions should be 
treated as CDO tranches under SACCR. For an nth-to-default transaction on a pool of m reference 
names, banks must use an attachment point of A=(n–1)/m and a detachment point of D=n/m in order 
to calculate the supervisory delta formula set out 6.43.

(1) For European, Asian, American and Bermudan put and call options, the
supervisory delta must be calculated using the simplified Black-Scholes 
formula referenced in 6.42. In the case of Asian options, the underlying price 
must be set equal to the current value of the average used in the payoff. In the 
case of American and Bermudan options, the latest allowed exercise date must 
be used as the exercise date 𝑅�𝑖 in the formula.
(2) For Bermudan swaptions, the start date 𝑅�𝑖 must be equal to the earliest allowed
exercise date, while the end date 𝐴�𝑖 must be equal to the end date of the 
underlying swap.
(3) For digital options, the payoff of each digital option (bought or sold) with
strike 𝐾𝑖 must be approximated via the “collar” combination of bought and 
sold European options of the same type (call or put), with the strikes set equal 
to 0.95∙𝑘𝑖 and 1.05∙𝑘𝑖. The size of the position in the collar components must 
be such that the digital payoff is reproduced exactly outside the region 
between the two strikes. The effective notional is then computed for the 
bought and sold European components of the collar separately, using the 
option formulae for the supervisory delta referenced in 6.42 (the exercise date 
𝑅�𝑖and the current value of the underlying 𝑀�𝑖 of the digital option must be used). 
The absolute value of the digital-option effective notional must be capped by 
the ratio of the digital payoff to the relevant supervisory factor.
(4) If a trade’s payoff can be represented as a combination of European option
payoffs (e.g. collar, butterfly/calendar spread, straddle, strangle), each 
European option component must be treated as a separate trade.
6.45. For the purposes of effective notional calculations, multiple-payment options
may be represented as a combination of single-payment options. In particular, 
interest rate caps/floors may be represented as the portfolio of individual caplets 
/floorlets, each of which is a European option on the floating interest rate over a 
specific coupon period. For each caplet/floorlet, 𝑅�𝑖and 𝑅�𝑖are the time periods 
starting from the current date to the start of the coupon period, while 𝐴�𝑖 is the 
time period starting from the current date to the end of the coupon period.
6.46. In the case of options (e.g. interest rate caps/floors that may be represented as the
portfolio of individual caplets/floorlets), banks may decompose those products in 
a manner consistent with 6.45. Banks may not decompose linear products (e.g. 
ordinary interest rate swaps).

6.47. Supervisory factors (𝑅�𝐴�𝑖) are used, together with aggregation formulas, to convert
effective notional amounts into the add-on for each hedging set.18 The way in 
which supervisory factors are used within the aggregation formulas varies 
between asset classes. The supervisory factors are listed in Table 2 under 6.75.
Hedging sets
6.48. The hedging sets in the different asset classes are defined as follows, except for
those described in 6.49 and 6.50:
(1) Interest rate derivatives consist of a separate hedging set for each currency.  
(2) FX derivatives consist of a separate hedging set for each currency pair.  
(3) Credit derivatives consist of a single hedging set.  
(4) Equity derivatives consist of a single hedging set.  
(5) Commodity derivatives consist of four hedging sets defined for broad
categories of commodity derivatives: energy, metals, agricultural and other 
commodities.
6.49. Derivatives that reference the basis between two risk factors and are denominated
in a single currency19 (basis transactions) must be treated within separate hedging 
sets within the corresponding asset class. There is a separate hedging set20 for 
each pair of risk factors (i.e. for each specific basis). Examples of specific bases 
include three-month Libor versus six-month Libor, three-month Libor versus 
three-month T-Bill, one-month Libor versus overnight indexed swap rate, Brent 
Crude oil versus Henry Hub gas. For hedging sets consisting of basis transactions, 
the supervisory factor applicable to a given asset class must be multiplied by one-
half.
6.50. Derivatives that reference the volatility of a risk factor (volatility transactions)
must be treated within separate hedging sets within the corresponding asset class. 
Volatility hedging sets must follow the same hedging set construction outlined in 
6.48 (for example, all equity volatility transactions form a single hedging set). 
Examples of volatility transactions include variance and volatility swaps, options 
on realized or implied volatility. For hedging sets consisting of volatility
18 Each factor has been calibrated to result in an add-on that reflects the Effective EPE of a single at-
the-money linear trade of unit notional and one-year maturity. This includes the estimate of realized 
volatilities assumed by supervisors for each underlying asset class. 
19 Derivatives with two floating legs that are denominated in different currencies (such as cross-
currency swaps) are not subject to this treatment; rather, they should be treated as non-basis foreign 
exchange contracts. 
20 Within this hedging set, long and short positions are determined with respect to the basis.

transactions, the supervisory factor applicable to a given asset class must be 
multiplied by a factor of five.21
Maturity factors
6.51. The minimum time risk horizon for an unmargined transaction is the lesser of one
year and the remaining maturity of the derivative contract, floored at ten business 
days.22 Therefore, the calculation of the effective notional for an unmargined 
transaction includes the following maturity factor, where 𝑀𝑖 is the remaining 
maturity of transaction i, floored at 10 business days:
(𝑘�𝑘�𝑘�𝑎𝑘�𝑎�𝑖𝑘�𝑎�𝑎�) = √min⁡{𝑀𝑖; 1𝑥�𝑐�𝑎𝑟}
1⁡𝑥�𝑐�𝑎𝑟
𝑀𝐴�𝑖
6.52. The maturity parameter (𝑀𝑖) is expressed in years but is subject to a floor of 10
business days. Banks should use standard market convention to convert business 
days into years, and vice versa. For example, 250 business days in a year, which 
results in a floor of 10/250 years for𝑀𝑖.
6.53. For margined transactions, the maturity factor is calculated using the margin
period of risk (MPOR), subject to specified floors. That is, banks must first 
estimate the margin period of risk (as defined in 4.17) for each of their netting 
sets. They must then use the higher of their estimated margin period of risk and 
the relevant floor in the calculation of the maturity factor (6.55). The floors for 
the margin period of risk are as follows:
(1) Ten business days for non-centrally-cleared transactions subject to daily
margin agreements.
(2) The sum of nine business days plus the re-margining period for non-centrally
cleared transactions that are not subject daily margin agreements.
(3) The relevant floors for centrally cleared transactions are prescribed in the
capital requirements for bank exposures to central counterparties (see in 
Chapter 8 of this framework).
21 For equity and commodity volatility transactions, the underlying volatility or variance referenced by 
the transaction should replace the unit price and contractual notional should replace the number of 
units. 
22 For example, remaining maturity for a one-month option on a 10-year Treasury bond is the one-
month to expiration date of the derivative contract. However, the end date of the transaction is the 10-
year remaining maturity on the Treasury bond.

6.54. The following are exceptions to the floors on the minimum margin period of risk
set out in 6.53 above:
(1) For netting sets consisting of more than 5000 transactions that are not with a
central counterparty the floor on the margin period of risk is 20 business days.
(2) For netting sets containing one or more trades involving either illiquid
collateral, or an OTC derivative that cannot be easily replaced, the floor on the 
margin period of risk is 20 business days. For these purposes, "Illiquid 
collateral" and "OTC derivatives that cannot be easily replaced" must be 
determined in the context of stressed market conditions and will be 
characterized by the absence of continuously active markets where a 
counterparty would, within two or fewer days, obtain multiple price quotations 
that would not move the market or represent a price reflecting a market 
discount (in the case of collateral) or premium (in the case of an OTC 
derivative). Examples of situations where trades are deemed illiquid for this 
purpose include, but are not limited to, trades that are not marked daily and 
trades that are subject to specific accounting treatment for valuation purposes 
(e.g. OTC derivatives transactions referencing securities whose fair value is 
determined by models with inputs that are not observed in the market).
(3) If a bank has experienced more than two margin call disputes on a particular
netting set over the previous two quarters that have lasted longer than the 
applicable margin period of risk (before consideration of this provision), then 
the bank must reflect this history appropriately by doubling the applicable 
supervisory floor on the margin period of risk for that netting set for the 
subsequent two quarters.
(4) In the case of non-centrally cleared derivatives that are subject to the
requirements under Margin requirements, 6.55(3) applies only to variation 
margin call disputes.
6.55. The calculation of the effective notional for a margined transaction includes the
following maturity factor, where 𝑀𝑀�𝑀�𝑅𝑖 is the margin period of risk appropriate 
for the margin agreement containing the transaction i (subject to the floors set out 
in 6.53 and 6.54 above).

denominator. Banks should use standard market convention to convert business 
days into years, and vice versa. For example, 1 year can be converted into 250 
business days in the denominator of the MF formula if MPOR is expressed in 
business days. Alternatively, the MPOR expressed in business days can be 
converted into years by dividing it by 250.
Supervisory correlation parameters
6.57. The supervisory correlation parameters (𝜌𝑖) only apply to the PFE add-on
calculation for equity, credit and commodity derivatives, and are set out in Table 
2 under 6.75. For these asset classes, the supervisory correlation parameters are 
derived from a single-factor model and specify the weight between systematic 
and idiosyncratic components. This weight determines the degree of offset 
between individual trades, recognizing that imperfect hedges provide some, but 
not perfect, offset. Supervisory correlation parameters do not apply to interest rate 
and foreign exchange derivatives.
Asset class level add-ons
6.58. As set out in 6.27, the aggregate add-on for a netting set (𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝑎𝑎�𝑎�𝑘�𝑎�𝑎�𝑎𝑘�𝑎�) is
calculated as the sum of the add-ons calculated for each asset class within the 
netting set. The sections that follow set out the calculation of the add-on for each 
asset class.
Add-on for interest rate derivatives
6.59. The calculation of the add-on for the interest rate derivative asset class captures
the risk of interest rate derivatives of different maturities being imperfectly 
correlated. It does this by allocating trades to maturity buckets, in which full 
offsetting of long and short positions is permitted, and by using an aggregation 
formula that only permits limited offsetting between maturity buckets. This 
allocation of derivatives to maturity buckets and the process of aggregation (steps 
3 to 5 below) are only used in the interest rate derivative asset class.
6.60. The add-on for the interest rate derivative asset class (𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝐻�𝑅) within a netting
set is calculated using the following steps:
(1) Step 1: Calculate the effective notional for each trade in the netting set that is
in the interest rate derivative asset class. This is calculated as the product of 
the following three terms:  
(i) 
the adjusted notional of the trade (d);

(ii) 
the supervisory delta adjustment of the trade (𝛼�); and
(iii) the maturity factor (MF). That is, for each trade i, the effective notional
𝐴�𝑖 is calculated as 𝐴�𝑖 = 𝑐�𝑖 ∗ 𝑀𝐴�𝑖 ∗ 𝛼�𝑖, where each term is as defined in 
6.35 to 6.56.
(2) Step 2: Allocate the trades in the interest rate derivative [including inflation
derivatives] asset class to hedging sets. In the interest rate derivative asset 
class the hedging sets consist of all the derivatives that reference the same 
currency.
(3) Step 3: Within each hedging set allocate each of the trades to the following
three maturity buckets: less than one year (bucket 1), between one and five 
years (bucket 2) and more than five years (bucket 3).
(4) Step 4: Calculate the effective notional of each maturity bucket by adding
together all the trade level effective notionals calculated in step 1 of the trades 
within the maturity bucket. Let 𝐴�𝐴�1, 𝐴�𝐴�1⁡and 𝐴�𝐴�1⁡be the effective notionals 
of buckets 1, 2 and 3 respectively.
(5) Step 5: Calculate the effective notional of the hedging set (𝐴�𝑀�𝐻𝑅�) by using
either of the two following aggregation formulas (the latter is to be used if the 
bank chooses not to recognize offsets between long and short positions across 
maturity buckets):
𝑀�𝑐�𝑐�𝑟�𝑐�𝑟�⁡𝑐�𝑘�𝑟𝑘�𝑟�𝑘�𝑎:⁡𝐴�𝑀�𝐻𝑅�
= [(𝐴�𝐴�1)2 + (𝐴�𝐴�2)2 + (𝐴�𝐴�3)2 + 1.4 ∗ 𝐴�𝐴�1 ∗ 𝐴�𝐴�2 + 1.4 ∗ 𝐴�𝐴�2 ∗ 𝐴�𝐴�3 + 0.6

(6) Step 6: Calculate the hedging set level add-on (𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝐻𝑅�) by multiplying the
effective notional of the hedging set (𝐴�𝑀�𝐻𝑅�) by the prescribed supervisory 
factor (𝑅�𝐴�𝐻𝑅�). The prescribed supervisory factor in the interest rate asset class 
is set at 0.5%, which means that 𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝐻𝑅� = 𝐴�𝑀�𝐻𝑅� ∗ 0.005.
(7) Step 7: Calculate the asset class level add-on (𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝐻�𝑅) by adding together
all of the hedging set level add-ons calculated in step 6:
𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝐻�𝑅 = ∑ 𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝐻𝑅�

Add-on for foreign exchange derivatives
6.61. The steps to calculate the add-on for the foreign exchange derivative asset class
are similar to the steps for the interest rate derivative asset class, except that there 
is no allocation of trades to maturity buckets (which means that there is full

offsetting of long and short positions within the hedging sets of the foreign 
exchange derivative asset class).
6.62. The add-on for the foreign exchange derivative asset class (𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝐴�𝑋) within a
netting set is calculated using the following steps:
(1) Step 1: Calculate the effective notional for each trade in the netting set that is
in the foreign exchange derivative asset class. This is calculated as the product 
of the following three terms: (i) the adjusted notional of the trade (d); (ii) the 
supervisory delta adjustment of the trade (𝛼�); and (iii) the maturity factor 
(MF). That is, for each trade i, the effective notional 𝐴�𝑖is calculated as 𝐴�𝑖 =
𝑐�𝑖 ∗ 𝑀𝐴�𝑖 ∗ 𝛼�𝑖, where each term is as defined in 6.35 to 6.56.
(2) Step 2: Allocate the trades in the foreign exchange derivative asset class to
hedging sets. In the foreign exchange derivative asset class the hedging sets 
consist of all the derivatives that reference the same currency pair.
(3) Step 3: Calculate the effective notional of each hedging set (𝐴�𝑀�𝐻𝑅�) by adding
together the trade level effective notionals calculated in step 1.
(4) Step 4: Calculate the hedging set level add-on (𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝐻𝑅�) by multiplying the
HS absolute value of the effective notional of the hedging set (𝐴�𝑀�𝐻𝑅� ) by the 
HS prescribed supervisory factor (𝑅�𝐴�𝐻𝑅�). The prescribed supervisory factor in 
the HS foreign exchange derivative asset class is set at 4%, which means that 
𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝐻𝑅� = |𝐴�𝑀�𝐻𝑅�| ∗ 0.04.
(5) Step 5: Calculate the asset class level add-on (𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝐴�𝑋) by adding together
all of the hedging set level add-ons calculated in step 5:
𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝐴�𝑋 = ∑ 𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝐻𝑘�

Add-on for credit derivatives
6.63. The calculation of the add-on for the credit derivative asset class only gives full
recognition of the offsetting of long and short positions for derivatives that 
reference the same entity (e.g. the same corporate issuer of bonds). Partial 
offsetting is recognized between derivatives that reference different entities in 
step 4 below. The formula used in step 4 is explained further in 6.65 to 6.67.
6.64. The add-on for the credit derivative asset class (𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝐴�𝑘�𝑎�𝑎�𝑖𝑘�) within a netting
set is calculated using the following steps:

(1) Step 1: Calculate the effective notional for each trade in the netting set that is
in the credit derivative asset class. This is calculated as the product of the 
following three terms:  
(i) 
the adjusted notional of the trade (d);
(ii) 
the supervisory delta adjustment of the trade (𝛼�); and
(iii) the maturity factor (MF). That is, for each trade i, the effective notional
𝐴�𝑖 is calculated as 𝐴�𝑖 = 𝑐�𝑖 ∗ 𝑀𝐴�𝑖 ∗ 𝛼�𝑖, where each term is as defined in 
6.35 to 6.56.
(2) Step 2: Calculate the combined effective notional for all derivatives that
reference the same entity. Each separate credit index that is referenced by 
derivatives in the credit derivative asset class should be treated as a separate 
entity. The combined effective notional of the entity (𝐴�𝑀�𝑎�𝑘�𝑘�𝑖𝑘�𝑦) is calculated 
by adding together the trade level effective notionals calculated in step 1 that 
reference that entity.
(3) Step 3: Calculate the add-on for each entity (𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝑎�𝑘�𝑘�𝑖𝑘�𝑦) by multiplying the
entity combined effective notional for that entity calculated in step 2 by the 
supervisory factor that is specified for that entity (𝑅�𝐴�𝑎�𝑘�𝑘�𝑖𝑘�𝑦). The supervisory 
entity factors vary according to the credit rating of the entity in the case of 
single name derivatives, and whether the index is considered investment grade 
or non-investment grade in the case of derivatives that reference an index. The 
supervisory factors are set out in Table 2 in 6.75.
(4) Step 4: Calculate the asset class level add-on (𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝐴�𝑘�𝑎�𝑎�𝑖𝑘�) by using the
formula that follows. In the formula the summations are across all entities 
referenced by the derivatives, 𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝑎�𝑘�𝑘�𝑖𝑘�𝑦is the add-on amount calculated 
entity in step 3 for each entity referenced by the derivatives and ρ is the entity 
supervisory prescribed correlation factor corresponding to the entity. As set 
out in Table 2 in 6.75, the correlation factor is 50% for single entities and 80% 
for indices.

component and an idiosyncratic component. The entity-level add-ons are allowed 
to offset each other fully in the systematic component; whereas, there is no 
offsetting benefit in the idiosyncratic component. These two components are 
weighted by a correlation factor which determines the degree of offsetting / 
hedging benefit within the credit derivatives asset class. The higher the 
correlation factor, the higher the importance of the systematic component, hence 
the higher the degree of offsetting benefits.
6.66. It should be noted that a higher or lower correlation does not necessarily mean a
higher or lower capital requirement. For portfolios consisting of long and short 
credit positions, a high correlation factor would reduce the charge. For portfolios 
consisting exclusively of long positions (or short positions), a higher correlation 
factor would increase the charge. If most of the risk consists of systematic risk, 
then individual reference entities would be highly correlated and long and short 
positions should offset each other. If, however, most of the risk is idiosyncratic 
to a reference entity, then individual long and short positions would not be 
effective hedges for each other.
6.67. The use of a single hedging set for credit derivatives implies that credit
derivatives from different industries and regions are equally able to offset the 
systematic component of an exposure, although they would not be able to offset 
the idiosyncratic portion. This approach recognizes that meaningful distinctions 
between industries and/or regions are complex and difficult to analyze for global 
conglomerates.
Add-on for equity derivatives
6.68. The calculation of the add-on for the equity derivative asset class is very similar
to the calculation of the add-on for the credit derivative asset class. It only gives 
full recognition of the offsetting of long and short positions for derivatives that 
reference the same entity (e.g. the same corporate issuer of shares). Partial 
offsetting is recognized between derivatives that reference different entities in 
step 4 below.
6.69. The add-on for the equity derivative asset class (𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝐴�𝑘�𝑘�𝑖𝑘�𝑦) within a netting
set is calculated using the following steps:

(1) Step 1: Calculate the effective notional for each trade in the netting set that is
in the equity derivative asset class. This is calculated as the product of the 
following three terms:  
(i) 
the adjusted notional of the trade (d);
(ii) 
the supervisory delta adjustment of the trade (𝛼�); and
(iii) the maturity factor (MF). That is, for each trade i, the effective notional
𝐴�𝑖 is calculated as 𝐴�𝑖 = 𝑐�𝑖 ∗ 𝑀𝐴�𝑖 ∗ 𝛼�𝑖, where each term is as defined in 
6.35 to 6.56.
(2) Step 2: Calculate the combined effective notional for all derivatives that
reference the same entity. Each separate equity index that is referenced by 
derivatives in the equity derivative asset class should be treated as a separate 
entity. The combined effective notional of the entity (𝐴�𝑀�𝑎�𝑘�𝑘�𝑖𝑘�𝑦 ) is calculated 
entity by adding together the trade level effective notionals calculated in step 
1 that reference that entity.
(3) Step 3: Calculate the add-on for each entity (𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝑎�𝑘�𝑘�𝑖𝑘�𝑦) by multiplying the
entity combined effective notional for that entity calculated in step 2 by the 
supervisory factor that is specified for that entity (𝑅�𝐴�𝑎�𝑘�𝑘�𝑖𝑘�𝑦). The supervisory 
entity factors are set out in Table 2 in 6.75 and vary according to whether the 
entity is a single name (𝑅�𝐴�𝑎�𝑘�𝑘�𝑖𝑘�𝑦 = 32%) or an index (𝑅�𝐴�𝑎�𝑘�𝑘�𝑖𝑘�𝑦 = 20%).
(4) Step 4: Calculate the asset class level add-on (𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝐴�𝑘�𝑘�𝑖𝑘�𝑦) by using the
formula that follows. In the formula the summations are across all entities 
referenced by the derivatives, 𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝑎�𝑘�𝑘�𝑖𝑘�𝑦⁡is the add-on amount calculated 
entity in step 3 for each entity referenced by the derivatives and 𝜌𝑎�𝑘�𝑘�𝑖𝑘�𝑦 is the 
entity supervisory prescribed correlation factor corresponding to the entity. As 
set out in Table 2 in 6.75, the correlation factor is 50% for single entities and 
80% for indices.

6.70. The supervisory factors for equity derivatives were calibrated based on estimates
of the market volatility of equity indices, with the application of a conservative 
beta factor23 to translate this estimate into an estimate of individual volatilities.
6.71. Banks are not permitted to make any modelling assumptions in the calculation of
the PFE add-ons, including estimating individual volatilities or taking publicly 
available estimates of beta. This is a pragmatic approach to ensure a consistent 
implementation across jurisdictions but also to keep the add-on calculation 
relatively simple and prudent. Therefore, bank must only use the two values of 
supervisory factors that are defined for equity derivatives, one for single entities 
and one for indices.
Add-on for commodity derivatives
6.72. The calculation of the add-on for the commodity derivative asset class is similar
to the calculation of the add-on for the credit and equity derivative asset classes. 
It recognizes the full offsetting of long and short positions for derivatives that 
reference the same type of underlying commodity. It also allows partial offsetting 
between derivatives that reference different types of commodity, however, this 
partial offsetting is only permitted within each of the four hedging sets of the 
commodity derivative asset class, where the different commodity types are more 
likely to demonstrate some stable, meaningful joint dynamics. Offsetting between 
hedging sets is not recognized (e.g., a forward contract on crude oil cannot hedge 
a forward contract on corn).
6.73. The add-on for the commodity derivative asset class (𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝐴�𝑘�𝑘�𝑘�𝑘�𝑎�𝑖𝑘�𝑦) within
a netting set is calculated using the following steps:
(1) Step 1: Calculate the effective notional for each trade in the netting set that is
in the commodity derivative asset class. This is calculated as the product of 
the following three terms:  
(i) 
the adjusted notional of the trade (d);
(ii) 
the supervisory delta adjustment of the trade (𝛼�); and
23 The beta of an individual equity measures the volatility of the stock relative to a broad market 
index. A value of beta greater than one means the individual equity is more volatile than the index. 
The greater the beta is, the more volatile the stock. The beta is calculated by running a linear 
regression of the stock on the broad index.

(iii) the maturity factor (MF). That is, for each trade i, the effective notional
𝐴�𝑖is calculated as 𝐴�𝑖 − 𝑐�𝑖 ∗ 𝑀𝐴�𝑖 ∗ 𝛼�𝑖, where each term is as defined in 
6.35 to 6.56.
(2) Step 2: Allocate the trades in commodity derivative asset class to hedging sets.
In the commodity derivative asset class there are four hedging sets consisting 
of derivatives that reference: energy, metals, agriculture and other 
commodities.
(3) Step 3: Calculate the combined effective notional for all derivatives with each
hedging set that reference the same commodity type (e.g. all derivative that 
reference copper within the metals hedging set). The combined effective 
notional of the commodity type (𝐴�𝑀�𝐴�𝑘�𝑘�𝑅�𝑦𝑘�𝑎�) is calculated by adding 
ComType together the trade level effective notionals calculated in step 1 that 
reference that commodity type.
(4) Step 4: Calculate the add-on for each commodity type (𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝐴�𝑘�𝑘�𝑅�𝑦𝑘�𝑎�)
within each hedging set by multiplying the combined effective notional for 
that commodity calculated in step 3 by the supervisory factor that is specified 
for that commodity type (𝑅�𝐴�𝐴�𝑘�𝑘�𝑅�𝑦𝑘�𝑎�). The supervisory factors are ComType 
set out in Table 2 in 6.75 and are set at 40% for electricity derivatives and 18% 
for derivatives that reference all other types of commodities.
(5) Step 5: Calculate the add-on for each of the four commodity hedging sets
(𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝐻𝑅�) by using the formula that follows. In the formula the summations 
are across all commodity types within the hedging set, 𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝐴�𝑘�𝑘�𝑅�𝑦𝑘�𝑎� is the 
add-on amount ComType calculated in step 4 for each commodity type and 
𝜌𝐴�𝑘�𝑘�𝑅�𝑦𝑘�𝑎� is the supervisory ComType prescribed correlation factor 
corresponding to the commodity type. As set out in Table 2 in 6.75, the 
correlation factor is set at 40% for all commodity types.

6.74. Regarding the calculation steps above, defining individual commodity types is
operationally difficult. In fact, it is impossible to fully specify all relevant 
distinctions between commodity types so that all basis risk is captured. For 
example crude oil could be a commodity type within the energy hedging set, but 
in certain cases this definition could omit a substantial basis risk between 
different types of crude oil (West Texas Intermediate, Brent, Saudi Light, etc.) 
Also, the four commodity type hedging sets have been defined without regard to 
characteristics such as location and quality. For example, the energy hedging set 
contains commodity types such as crude oil, electricity, natural gas and coal. 
SAMA may require banks to use more refined definitions of commodities when 
they are significantly exposed to the basis risk of different products within those 
commodity types.

6.76. For a hedging set consisting of basis transactions, the supervisory factor
applicable to its relevant asset class must be multiplied by one-half. For a hedging 
set consisting of volatility transactions, the supervisory factor applicable to its 
relevant asset class must be multiplied by a factor of five.
Treatment of multiple margin agreements and multiple netting sets
6.77. If multiple margin agreements apply to a single netting set, the netting set must
be divided into sub-netting sets that align with their respective margin agreement. 
This treatment applies to both RC and PFE components.
6.78. If a single margin agreement applies to several netting sets, special treatment is
necessary because it is problematic to allocate the common collateral to 
individual netting sets. The replacement cost at any given time is determined by 
the sum of two terms. The first term is equal to the unmargined current exposure 
of the bank to the counterparty aggregated across all netting sets within the 
margin agreement reduced by the positive current net collateral (i.e. collateral is 
subtracted only when the bank is a net holder of collateral). The second term is 
non-zero only when the bank is a net poster of collateral: it is equal to the current 
net posted collateral (if there is any) reduced by the unmargined current exposure

of the counterparty to the bank aggregated across all netting sets within the 
margin agreement. Net collateral available to the bank should include both VM 
and NICA. Mathematically, RC for the entire margin agreement is calculated as 
follows, where:
(1) where the summation NS 𝜖 MA is across the netting sets covered by the
margin agreement (hence the notation)
(2) V is the current mark-to-market value of the netting set NS and 𝐴�𝑀𝐴⁡is the cash
equivalent value of all currently available collateral under the margin 
agreement

6.79. Where a single margin agreement applies to several netting sets as described in
6.78 above, collateral will be exchanged based on mark-to-market values that are 
netted across all transactions covered under the margin agreement, irrespective of 
netting sets. That is, collateral exchanged on a net basis may not be sufficient to 
cover PFE. In this situation, therefore, the PFE add-on must be calculated 
according to the unmargined methodology. Netting set-level PFEs are then

Treatment of collateral taken outside of netting sets
6.80. Eligible collateral which is taken outside a netting set, but is available to a bank
to offset losses due to counterparty default on one netting set only, should be 
treated as an independent collateral amount associated with the netting set and 
used within the calculation of replacement cost under 6.12 when the netting set is 
unmargined and under 6.20 when the netting set is margined. Eligible collateral 
which is taken outside a netting set, and is available to a bank to offset losses due 
to counterparty default on more than one netting set, should be treated as 
collateral taken under a margin agreement applicable to multiple netting sets, in 
which case the treatment under 6.78 and 6.79 applies. If eligible collateral is 
available to offset losses on non-derivatives exposures as well as exposures

determined using the SA-CCR, only that portion of the collateral assigned to the 
derivatives may be used to reduce the derivatives exposure.
7. Internal models method for counterparty credit risk
Approval to adopt an internal models method to estimate EAD
7.1. 
A bank that wishes to adopt an internal models method to measure exposure or 
exposure at default (EAD) for regulatory capital purposes must seek SAMA 
approval. The internal models method is available both for banks that adopt the 
internal ratings-based approach to credit risk and for banks for which the 
standardized approach to credit risk applies to all of their credit risk exposures. 
The bank must meet all of the requirements given in 7.6 to 7.60 and must apply 
the method to all of its exposures that are subject to counterparty credit risk, 
except for long settlement transactions.
7.2. 
A bank may also choose to adopt an internal models method to measure 
counterparty credit risk (CCR) for regulatory capital purposes for its exposures 
or EAD to only over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, to only securities financing 
transactions (SFTs), or to both, subject to the appropriate recognition of netting 
specified in 7.61 to 7.71. The bank must apply the method to all relevant 
exposures within that category, except for those that are immaterial in size and 
risk. During the initial implementation of the internal models method, a bank may 
use the Standardized Approach for counterparty credit risk for a portion of its 
business. The bank must submit a plan to SAMA to bring all material exposures 
for that category of transactions under the internal models method.
7.3. 
For all OTC derivative transactions and for all long settlement transactions for 
which a bank has not received approval from SAMA to use the internal models 
method, the bank must use the standardized approach to counterparty credit risk 
(SA-CCR, in Chapter 6 of this framework).
7.4. 
Exposures or EAD arising from long settlement transactions can be determined 
using either of the methods identified in this framework regardless of the methods 
chosen for treating OTC derivatives and SFTs. In computing capital requirements 
for long settlement transactions banks that hold permission to use the internal 
ratings-based approach may opt to apply the risk weights under this Framework’s

After adoption of the internal models method, the bank must comply with the 
above requirements on a permanent basis. Only under exceptional circumstances 
or for immaterial exposures can a bank revert to the standardized approach for 
counterparty credit risk for all or part of its exposure. The bank must demonstrate 
that reversion to a less sophisticated method does not lead to an arbitrage of the 
regulatory capital rules.
Exposure amount or EAD under the internal models method
7.6. 
CCR exposure or EAD is measured at the level of the netting set as defined in 
Chapter 4 of this framework and 7.61 to 7.71 of this framework. A qualifying 
internal model for measuring counterparty credit exposure must specify the 
forecasting distribution for changes in the market value of the netting set 
attributable to changes in market variables, such as interest rates, foreign 
exchange rates, etc. The model then computes the bank’s CCR exposure for the 
netting set at each future date given the changes in the market variables. For 
margined counterparties, the model may also capture future collateral 
movements. Banks may include eligible financial collateral as defined in 9.37 of 
the Minimum Capital Requirements for Credit Risk and 9.2 of this framework in 
their forecasting distributions for changes in the market value of the netting set, 
if the quantitative, qualitative and data requirements for internal models method 
are met for the collateral.
7.7. 
Banks that use the internal models method must calculate credit RWA as the 
higher of two amounts, one based on current parameter estimates and one based 
on stressed parameter estimates. Specifically, to determine the default risk capital 
requirement for counterparty credit risk, banks must use the greater of the 
portfolio-level capital requirement (not including the credit valuation adjustment, 
or CVA, charge in Chapter 11 of this Framework) based on Effective expected 
positive exposure (EPE) using current market data and the portfolio level capital 
requirement based on Effective EPE using a stress calibration.24 The stress 
calibration should be a single consistent stress calibration for the whole portfolio 
of counterparties. The greater of Effective EPE using current market data and the
24 Effective expected positive exposure (EPE) using current market data to be compared with 
Effective EPE using a stress calibration on annual basis during ICAAP

stress calibration should not be applied on a counterparty by counterparty basis, 
but on a total portfolio level.
7.8. 
To the extent that a bank recognizes collateral in EAD via current exposure, a 
bank would not be permitted to recognize the benefits in its estimates of loss 
given-default (LGD). As a result, the bank would be required to use an LGD of 
an otherwise similar uncollateralized facility. In other words, the bank would be 
required to use an LGD that does not include collateral that is already included in 
EAD.
7.9. 
Under the internal models method, the bank need not employ a single model. 
Although the following text describes an internal model as a simulation model, 
no particular form of model is required. Analytical models are acceptable so long 
as they are subject to supervisory review, meet all of the requirements set forth in 
this section and are applied to all material exposures subject to a CCR-related 
capital requirement as noted above, with the exception of long settlement 
transactions, which are treated separately, and with the exception of those 
exposures that are immaterial in size and risk.
7.10. Expected exposure or peak exposure measures should be calculated based on a
distribution of exposures that accounts for the possible non-normality of the 
distribution of exposures, including the existence of leptokurtosis (“fat tails”), 
where appropriate.
7.11. When using an internal model, exposure amount or EAD is calculated as the
product of alpha times Effective EPE, as specified below (except for 
counterparties that have been identified as having explicit specific wrong way 
risk – see 7.48) :
𝐴�𝐴𝐴� = 𝛼 × 𝐴�𝑐�𝑐�𝑐�𝑐𝑟�𝑖𝑟�𝑐�𝐴�𝑀�𝐴�  
  
 
(Equation 1)
7.12. Effective EPE is computed by estimating expected exposure (𝐴�𝐴�𝑘�) as the average
t exposure at future date t, where the average is taken across possible future values 
of relevant market risk factors, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, etc. 
The internal model estimates EE at a series of future dates 𝑟�1 , 𝑟�2 , 𝑟�3 …25
25 In theory, the expectations should be taken with respect to the actual probability distribution of 
future exposure and not the risk-neutral one. Supervisors recognize that practical considerations may 
make it more feasible to use the risk-neutral one. As a result, supervisors will not mandate which kind 
of forecasting distribution to employ.

Specifically, “Effective EE” is computed recursively using the following formula, 
where the current date is denoted as 𝑟�0 and Effective 𝐴�𝐴�𝑘�0 equals current 
exposure:
𝐴�𝑐�𝑐�𝑐�𝑐𝑟�𝑖𝑟�𝑐�𝐴�𝐴�𝑘�𝑘 = max⁡(𝐴�𝑐�𝑐�𝑐�𝑐𝑟�𝑖𝑟�𝑐�𝐴�𝐴�𝑘�𝑘−1, 𝐴�𝐴�𝑘�𝑘  
(Equation 2)
7.13. In this regard, “Effective EPE” is the average Effective EE during the first year
of future exposure. If all contracts in the netting set mature before one year, EPE 
is the average of expected exposure until all contracts in the netting set mature. 
Effective EPE is computed as a weighted average of Effective EE, using the 
following formula where the weights ∆𝑟�𝑘 = 𝑟�𝑘 − 𝑟�𝑘−1 allows for the case when 
future exposure is calculated at dates that are not equally spaced over time:
min⁡(1𝑦𝑎�𝑎𝑘�,𝑘�𝑎𝑘�𝑘�𝑘�𝑖𝑘�𝑦)
𝑘=1
 (Equation 3)
𝐴�𝑐�𝑐�𝑐�𝑐𝑟�𝑖𝑟�𝑐�𝐴�𝑀�𝐴� = ∑
𝐴�𝑐�𝑐�𝑐�𝑐𝑟�𝑖𝑟�𝑐�𝐴�𝐴�𝑘�𝑘 × ∆𝑟�𝑘
7.14. Alpha (𝛼) is set equal to 1.4.
7.15. SAMA may require a higher alpha based on a bank’s CCR exposures. Factors
that may require a higher alpha include the low granularity of counterparties; 
particularly high exposures to general wrong-way risk; particularly high 
correlation of market values across counterparties; and other institution specific 
characteristics of CCR exposures.
Own estimates for alpha
7.16. Banks should seek approval from SAMA to compute internal estimates of alpha
subject to a floor of 1.2, where alpha equals the ratio of economic capital from a 
full simulation of counterparty exposure across counterparties (numerator) and 
economic capital based on EPE (denominator), assuming they meet certain 
operating requirements. Eligible banks must meet all the operating requirements 
for internal estimates of EPE and must demonstrate that their internal estimates 
of alpha capture in the numerator the material sources of stochastic dependency 
of distributions of market values of transactions or of portfolios of transactions 
across counterparties (e.g. the correlation of defaults across counterparties and 
between market risk and default).
7.17. In the denominator, EPE must be used as if it were a fixed outstanding loan
amount.

## Page 52

7.18. To this end, banks must ensure that the numerator and denominator of alpha are
computed in a consistent fashion with respect to the modelling methodology, 
parameter specifications and portfolio composition. The approach used must be 
based on the bank’s internal economic capital approach, be well-documented and 
be subject to independent validation. In addition, banks must review their 
estimates on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when the composition 
of the portfolio varies over time. Banks must assess the model risk and inform 
SAMA of any significant variation in estimates of alpha that arises from the 
possibility for mis-specification in the models used for the numerator, especially 
where convexity is present.
7.19. Where appropriate, volatilities and correlations of market risk factors used in the
joint simulation of market and credit risk should be conditioned on the credit risk 
factor to reflect potential increases in volatility or correlation in an economic 
downturn. Internal estimates of alpha should take account of the granularity of 
exposures.
Maturity
7.20. If the original maturity of the longest-dated contract contained in the set is greater
than one year, the formula for effective maturity (M) in 12.42 of the Minimum 
Capital Requirements for Credit Risk is replaced with formula that follows, where 
𝑐�𝑐�𝐾 is the risk-free discount factor for future time period 𝑟�𝐾 and the remaining 
symbols are defined above. Similar to the treatment under corporate exposures, 
M has a cap of five years.26

7.21. For netting sets in which all contracts have an original maturity of less than 
one year, the formula for effective maturity (M) i in 12.42 of the Minimum 
Capital Requirements for Credit Risk  is unchanged and a floor of one year
26 Conceptually, M equals the effective credit duration of the counterparty exposure. A bank that uses 
an internal model to calculate a one-sided credit valuation adjustment (CVA) can use the effective 
credit duration estimated by such a model in place of the above formula with prior approval of 
SAMA.

applies, with the exception of short-term exposures as described in paragraphs in 
12.45 to 12.48 of the Minimum Capital Requirements for Credit Risk.
Margin agreements
7.22. If the netting set is subject to a margin agreement and the internal model captures
the effects of margining when estimating EE, the model’s EE measure may be 
used directly in (Equation 2) in 7.12. Such models are noticeably more 
complicated than models of EPE for unmargined counterparties.
7.23. An EPE model must also include transaction-specific information in order to
capture the effects of margining. It must take into account both the current amount 
of margin and margin that would be passed between counterparties in the future. 
Such a model must account for the nature of margin agreements (unilateral or 
bilateral), the frequency of margin calls, the margin period of risk, the thresholds 
of unmargined exposure the bank is willing to accept, and the minimum transfer 
amount. Such a model must either model the mark-to-market change in the value 
of collateral posted or apply this Framework’s rules for collateral.
7.24. For transactions subject to daily re-margining and mark-to-market valuation, a
supervisory floor of five business days for netting sets consisting only of repo 
style transactions, and 10 business days for all other netting sets is imposed on 
the margin period of risk used for the purpose of modelling EAD with margin 
agreements. In the following cases a higher supervisory floor is imposed:
(1) For all netting sets where the number of trades exceeds 5000 at any point
during a quarter, a supervisory floor of 20 business days is imposed for the 
margin period of risk for the following quarter.
(2) For netting sets containing one or more trades involving either illiquid
collateral, or an OTC derivative that cannot be easily replaced, a supervisory 
floor of 20 business days is imposed for the margin period of risk. For these 
purposes, "Illiquid collateral" and "OTC derivatives that cannot be easily 
replaced" must be determined in the context of stressed market conditions and 
will be characterized by the absence of continuously active markets where a 
counterparty would, within two or fewer days, obtain multiple price quotations 
that would not move the market or represent a price reflecting a market 
discount (in the case of collateral) or premium (in the case of an OTC 
derivative). Examples of situations where trades are deemed illiquid for this 
purpose include, but are not limited to, trades that are not marked daily and

trades that are subject to specific accounting treatment for valuation purposes 
(e.g. OTC derivatives or repo-style transactions referencing securities whose 
fair value is determined by models with inputs that are not observed in the 
market).
(3) In addition, a bank must consider whether trades or securities it holds as
collateral are concentrated in a particular counterparty and if that counterparty 
exited the market precipitously whether the bank would be able to replace its 
trades.
7.25. If a bank has experienced more than two margin call disputes on a particular
netting set over the previous two quarters that have lasted longer than the 
applicable margin period of risk (before consideration of this provision), then the 
bank must reflect this history appropriately by using a margin period of risk that 
is at least double the supervisory floor for that netting set for the subsequent two 
quarters.
7.26. For re-margining with a periodicity of N-days the margin period of risk should
be at least equal to the supervisory floor, F, plus the N days minus one day. That 
is:
𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑐�𝑖𝑘�⁡𝑀�𝑐�𝑟𝑖𝑘�𝑐�⁡𝑘�𝑐�⁡𝑅𝑖𝑟�𝑘 = 𝐴� + 𝑀� − 1
7.27. Banks using the internal models method must not capture the effect of a reduction
of EAD due to any clause in a collateral agreement that requires receipt of 
collateral when counterparty credit quality deteriorates.
Model validation
7.28. The extent to which banks meet the qualitative criteria may influence the level at
which SAMA will set the multiplication factor referred to in 7.14 (Alpha) above. 
Only those banks in full compliance with the qualitative criteria will be eligible 
for application of the minimum multiplication factor. The qualitative criteria 
include:
(1) The bank must conduct a regular program of backtesting, i.e. an ex-post
comparison of the risk measures generated by the model against realized risk 
measures, as well as comparing hypothetical changes based on static positions 
with realized measures. “Risk measures” in this context, refers not only to 
Effective EPE, the risk measure used to derive regulatory capital, but also to 
the other risk measures used in the calculation of Effective EPE such as the 
exposure distribution at a series of future dates, the positive exposure

distribution at a series of future dates, the market risk factors used to derive 
those exposures and the values of the constituent trades of a portfolio.
(2) The bank must carry out an initial validation and an on-going periodic review
of its IMM model and the risk measures generated by it. The validation and 
review must be independent of the model developers.
(3) The board of directors and senior management should be actively involved in
the risk control process and must regard credit and counterparty credit risk 
control as an essential aspect of the business to which significant resources 
need to be devoted. In this regard, the daily reports prepared by the 
independent risk control unit must be reviewed by a level of management with 
sufficient seniority and authority to enforce both reductions of positions taken 
by individual traders and reductions in the bank’s overall risk exposure.
(4) The bank’s internal risk measurement exposure model must be closely
integrated into the day-to-day risk management process of the bank. Its output 
should accordingly be an integral part of the process of planning, monitoring 
and controlling the bank’s counterparty credit risk profile.
(5) The risk measurement system should be used in conjunction with internal
trading and exposure limits. In this regard, exposure limits should be related 
to the bank’s risk measurement model in a manner that is consistent over time 
and that is well understood by traders, the credit function and senior 
management.
(6) Banks should have a routine in place for ensuring compliance with a
documented set of internal policies, controls and procedures concerning the 
operation of the risk measurement system. The bank’s risk measurement 
system must be well documented, for example, through a risk management 
manual that describes the basic principles of the risk management system and 
that provides an explanation of the empirical techniques used to measure 
counterparty credit risk.
(7) An independent review of the risk measurement system should be carried out
regularly in the bank’s own internal auditing process. This review should 
include both the activities of the business trading units and of the independent 
risk control unit. A review of the overall risk management process should take 
place at regular intervals (ideally no less than once a year) and should 
specifically address, at a minimum:
(a) The adequacy of the documentation of the risk management system and
process;
(b) The organization of the risk control unit;

(8) The on-going validation of counterparty credit risk models, including
backtesting, must be reviewed periodically by a level of management with 
sufficient authority to decide the course of action that will be taken to 
address weaknesses in the models.
7.29. Banks must document the process for initial and on-going validation of their IMM
model to a level of detail that would enable a third party to recreate the analysis. 
Banks must also document the calculation of the risk measures generated by the 
models to a level of detail that would allow a third party to recreate the risk 
measures. This documentation must set out the frequency with which backtesting 
analysis and any other on-going validation will be conducted, how the validation 
is conducted with respect to dataflows and portfolios and the analyses that are 
used.
7.30. Banks must define criteria with which to assess their EPE models and the models
that input into the calculation of EPE and have a written policy in place that 
describes the process by which unacceptable performance will be determined and 
remedied.

7.31. Banks must define how representative counterparty portfolios are constructed for
the purposes of validating an EPE model and its risk measures.
7.32. When validating EPE models and its risk measures that produce forecast
distributions, validation must assess more than a single statistic of the model 
distribution.
7.33. As part of the initial and on-going validation of an IMM model and its risk
measures, the following requirements must be met:
(1) A bank must carry out backtesting using historical data on movements in
market risk factors prior to SAMA approval. Backtesting must consider a 
number of distinct prediction time horizons out to at least one year, over a 
range of various start (initialization) dates and covering a wide range of market 
conditions.
(2) Banks must backtest the performance of their EPE model and the model’s
relevant risk measures as well as the market risk factor predictions that support 
EPE. For collateralized trades, the prediction time horizons considered must 
include those reflecting typical margin periods of risk applied in 
collateralized/margined trading, and must include long time horizons of at 
least 1 year.
(3) The pricing models used to calculate counterparty credit risk exposure for a
given scenario of future shocks to market risk factors must be tested as part of 
the initial and on-going model validation process. These pricing models may 
be different from those used to calculate Market Risk over a short horizon. 
Pricing models for options must account for the nonlinearity of option value 
with respect to market risk factors.
(4) An EPE model must capture transaction specific information in order to
aggregate exposures at the level of the netting set. Banks must verify that 
transactions are assigned to the appropriate netting set within the model.
(5) Static, historical backtesting on representative counterparty portfolios must be
a part of the validation process. At regular intervals as directed by SAMA, a 
bank must conduct such backtesting on a number of representative 
counterparty portfolios. The representative portfolios must be chosen based 
on their sensitivity to the material risk factors and correlations to which the 
bank is exposed. In addition, IMM banks need to conduct backtesting that is 
designed to test the key assumptions of the EPE model and the relevant risk

measures, e.g. the modelled relationship between tenors of the same risk 
factor, and the modelled relationships between risk factors.
(6) Significant differences between realized exposures and the forecast
distribution could indicate a problem with the model or the underlying data 
that SAMA would require the bank to correct. Under such circumstances, 
SAMA may require additional capital to be held while the problem is being 
solved.
(7) The performance of EPE models and its risk measures must be subject to good
backtesting practice. The backtesting program must be capable of identifying 
poor performance in an EPE model’s risk measures.
(8) Banks must validate their EPE models and all relevant risk measures out to
time horizons commensurate with the maturity of trades for which exposure 
is calculated using an internal models method.
(9) The pricing models used to calculate counterparty exposure must be regularly
tested against appropriate independent benchmarks as part of the on-going 
model validation process.
(10) The on-going validation of a bank’s EPE model and the relevant risk
measures include an assessment of recent performance.
(11) The frequency with which the parameters of an EPE model are updated
needs to be assessed as part of the validation process.
(12) Under the IMM, a measure that is more conservative than the metric used
to calculate regulatory EAD for every counterparty, may be used in place of 
alpha times Effective EPE with the prior approval of SAMA. The degree of 
relative conservatism will be assessed upon initial SAMA approval and at the 
regular supervisory reviews of the EPE models. The bank must validate the 
conservatism regularly.
(13) The on-going assessment of model performance needs to cover all
counterparties for which the models are used.
(14) The validation of IMM models must assess whether or not the bank level
and netting set exposure calculations of EPE are appropriate.
Operational requirements for EPE models
7.34. In order to be eligible to adopt an internal model for estimating EPE arising from
CCR for regulatory capital purposes, a bank must meet the following operational 
requirements. These include meeting the requirements related to the qualifying 
standards on CCR Management, a use test, stress testing, identification of 
wrongway risk, and internal controls.

Qualifying standards on CCR Management
7.35. The bank must satisfy SAMA that, in addition to meeting the operational
requirements identified in 7.36 to 7.60 below, it adheres to sound practices for 
CCR management, including those specified in Counterparty credit risks section 
of the Credit Risk chapter of the Supervisory Review Process in the Basel 
Framework.
Use test
7.36. The distribution of exposures generated by the internal model used to calculate
effective EPE must be closely integrated into the day-to-day CCR management 
process of the bank. For example, the bank could use the peak exposure from the 
distributions for counterparty credit limits or expected positive exposure for its 
internal allocation of capital. The internal model’s output must accordingly play 
an essential role in the credit approval, counterparty credit risk management, 
internal capital allocations, and corporate governance of banks that seek approval 
to apply such models for capital adequacy purposes. Models and estimates 
designed and implemented exclusively to qualify for the internal models method 
(IMM) are not acceptable.
7.37. A bank must have a credible track record in the use of internal models that
generate a distribution of exposures to CCR. Thus, the bank must demonstrate 
that it has been using an internal model to calculate the distributions of exposures 
upon which the EPE calculation is based that meets broadly the minimum 
requirements for at least one year prior to SAMA approval.
7.38. Banks employing the internal models method must have an independent control
unit that is responsible for the design and implementation of the bank’s CCR 
management system, including the initial and on-going validation of the internal 
model. This unit must control input data integrity and produce and analyze daily 
reports on the output of the bank’s risk measurement model, including an 
evaluation of the relationship between measures of CCR risk exposure and credit 
and trading limits. This unit must be independent from business credit and trading 
units; it must be adequately staffed; it must report directly to senior management 
of the bank. The work of this unit should be closely integrated into the day-to-
day credit risk management process of the bank. Its output should accordingly be 
an integral part of the process of planning, monitoring and controlling the bank’s 
credit and overall risk profile.

7.39. Banks applying the internal models method must have a collateral management
unit that is responsible for calculating and making margin calls, managing margin 
call disputes and reporting levels of independent amounts, initial margins and 
variation margins accurately on a daily basis. This unit must control the integrity 
of the data used to make margin calls, and ensure that it is consistent and 
reconciled regularly with all relevant sources of data within the bank. This unit 
must also track the extent of reuse of collateral (both cash and non-cash) and the 
rights that the bank gives away to its respective counterparties for the collateral 
that it posts. These internal reports must indicate the categories of collateral assets 
that are reused, and the terms of such reuse including instrument, credit quality 
and maturity. The unit must also track concentration to individual collateral asset 
classes accepted by the banks. Senior management must allocate sufficient 
resources to this unit for its systems to have an appropriate level of operational 
performance, as measured by the timeliness and accuracy of outgoing calls and 
response time to incoming calls. Senior management must ensure that this unit is 
adequately staffed to process calls and disputes in a timely manner even under 
severe market crisis, and to enable the bank to limit its number of large disputes 
caused by trade volumes.
7.40. The bank’s collateral management unit must produce and maintain appropriate
collateral management information that is reported on a regular basis to senior 
management. Such internal reporting should include information on the type of 
collateral (both cash and non-cash) received and posted, as well as the size, aging 
and cause for margin call disputes. This internal reporting should also reflect 
trends in these figures.
7.41. A bank employing the internal models method must ensure that its cash
management policies account simultaneously for the liquidity risks of potential 
incoming margin calls in the context of exchanges of variation margin or other 
margin types, such as initial or independent margin, under adverse market shocks, 
potential incoming calls for the return of excess collateral posted by 
counterparties, and calls resulting from a potential downgrade of its own public 
rating. The bank must ensure that the nature and horizon of collateral reuse is 
consistent with its liquidity needs and does not jeopardize its ability to post or 
return collateral in a timely manner.
7.42. The internal model used to generate the distribution of exposures must be part of
a counterparty risk management framework that includes the identification,

measurement, management, approval and internal reporting of counterparty 
risk.27 This Framework must include the measurement of usage of credit lines 
(aggregating counterparty exposures with other credit exposures) and economic 
capital allocation. In addition to EPE (a measure of future exposure), a bank must 
measure and manage current exposures. Where appropriate, the bank must 
measure current exposure gross and net of collateral held. The use test is satisfied 
if a bank uses other counterparty risk measures, such as peak exposure or potential 
future exposure (PFE), based on the distribution of exposures generated by the 
same model to compute EPE.
7.43. A bank is not required to estimate or report EE daily, but to meet the use test it
must have the systems capability to estimate EE daily, if necessary, unless it 
demonstrates to SAMA that its exposures to CCR warrant some less frequent 
calculation. It must choose a time profile of forecasting horizons that adequately 
reflects the time structure of future cash flows and maturity of the contracts. For 
example, a bank may compute EE on a daily basis for the first ten days, once a 
week out to one month, once a month out to eighteen months, once a quarter out 
to five years and beyond five years in a manner that is consistent with the 
materiality and composition of the exposure.
7.44. Exposure must be measured out to the life of all contracts in the netting set (not
just to the one year horizon), monitored and controlled. The bank must have 
procedures in place to identify and control the risks for counterparties where 
exposure rises beyond the one-year horizon. Moreover, the forecasted increase in 
exposure must be an input into the bank’s internal economic capital model.
Stress testing
7.45. A bank must have in place sound stress testing processes for use in the assessment
of capital adequacy. These stress measures must be compared against the measure 
of EPE and considered by the bank as part of its internal capital adequacy 
assessment process. Stress testing must also involve identifying possible events 
or future changes in economic conditions that could have unfavorable effects on 
a bank’s credit exposures and assessment of the bank’s ability to withstand such 
changes. Examples of scenarios that could be used are;
(i) 
economic or industry downturns,

Counterparty Risk Management Practices (June 1999).

(ii) 
market-place events, or
(iii) decreased liquidity conditions.
7.46. Banks must have a comprehensive stress testing program for counterparty credit
risk. The stress testing program must include the following elements:
(1) Banks must ensure complete trade capture and exposure aggregation across
all forms of counterparty credit risk (not just OTC derivatives) at the 
counterparty-specific level in a sufficient time frame to conduct regular stress 
testing.
(2) For all counterparties, banks should produce, at least monthly, exposure stress
testing of principal market risk factors (e.g. interest rates, FX, equities, credit 
spreads, and commodity prices) in order to proactively identify, and when 
necessary, reduce outsized concentrations to specific directional sensitivities.
(3) Banks should apply multifactor stress testing scenarios and assess material
non-directional risks (i.e. yield curve exposure, basis risks, etc.) at least 
quarterly. Multiple-factor stress tests should, at a minimum, aim to address 
scenarios in which a) severe economic or market events have occurred; b) 
broad market liquidity has decreased significantly; and c) the market impact 
of liquidating positions of a large financial intermediary. These stress tests 
may be part of bank-wide stress testing.
(4) Stressed market movements have an impact not only on counterparty
exposures, but also on the credit quality of counterparties. At least quarterly, 
banks should conduct stress testing applying stressed conditions to the joint 
movement of exposures and counterparty creditworthiness.
(5) Exposure stress testing (including single factor, multifactor and material non-
directional risks) and joint stressing of exposure and creditworthiness should 
be performed at the counterparty-specific, counterparty group (e.g. industry 
and region), and aggregate bank-wide CCR levels.
(6) Stress tests results should be integrated into regular reporting to senior
management. The analysis should capture the largest counterparty-level 
impacts across the portfolio, material concentrations within segments of the 
portfolio (within the same industry or region), and relevant portfolio and 
counterparty specific trends.
(7) The severity of factor shocks should be consistent with the purpose of the
stress test. When evaluating solvency under stress, factor shocks should be 
severe enough to capture historical extreme market environments and/or 
extreme but plausible stressed market conditions. The impact of such shocks

on capital resources should be evaluated, as well as the impact on capital 
requirements and earnings. For the purpose of day-to-day portfolio 
monitoring, hedging, and management of concentrations, banks should also 
consider scenarios of lesser severity and higher probability.
(8) Banks should consider reverse stress tests to identify extreme, but plausible,
scenarios that could result in significant adverse outcomes.
(9) Senior management must take a lead role in the integration of stress testing
into the risk management framework and risk culture of the bank and ensure 
that the results are meaningful and proactively used to manage counterparty 
credit risk. At a minimum, the results of stress testing for significant exposures 
should be compared to guidelines that express the bank’s risk appetite and 
elevated for discussion and action when excessive or concentrated risks are 
present.
Wrong-way risk
7.47. Banks must identify exposures that give rise to a greater degree of general wrong-
way risk. Stress testing and scenario analyses must be designed to identify risk 
factors that are positively correlated with counterparty credit worthiness. Such 
testing needs to address the possibility of severe shocks occurring when 
relationships between risk factors have changed. Banks should monitor general 
wrong way risk by product, by region, by industry, or by other categories that are 
germane to the business. Reports should be provided to senior management, the 
appropriate committee of the Board, or the delegated authority of the board on a 
regular basis that communicate wrong way risks and the steps that are being taken 
to manage that risk.
7.48. A bank is exposed to “specific wrong-way risk” if future exposure to a specific
counterparty is highly correlated with the counterparty’s probability of default. 
For example, a company writing put options on its own stock creates wrong-way 
exposures for the buyer that is specific to the counterparty. A bank must have 
procedures in place to identify, monitor and control cases of specific wrong way 
risk, beginning at the inception of a trade and continuing through the life of the 
trade. To calculate the CCR capital requirement, the instruments for which there 
exists a legal connection between the counterparty and the underlying issuer, and 
for which specific wrong way risk has been identified, are not considered to be in 
the same netting set as other transactions with the counterparty. Furthermore, for 
single-name credit default swaps where there exists a legal connection between

the counterparty and the underlying issuer, and where specific wrong way risk 
has been identified, EAD in respect of such swap counterparty exposure equals 
the full expected loss in the remaining fair value of the underlying instruments 
assuming the underlying issuer is in liquidation. The use of the full expected loss 
in remaining fair value of the underlying instrument allows the bank to recognize, 
in respect of such swap, the market value that has been lost already and any 
expected recoveries. Accordingly LGD for advanced or foundation IRB banks 
must be set to 100% for such swap transactions.28 For banks using the 
Standardized Approach, the risk weight to use is that of an unsecured transaction. 
For equity derivatives, bond options, securities financing transactions etc. 
referencing a single company where there exists a legal connection between the 
counterparty and the underlying company, and where specific wrong way risk has 
been identified, EAD equals the value of the transaction under the assumption of 
a jump-to-default of the underlying security. Inasmuch this makes re-use of 
possibly existing (market risk) calculations (for incremental risk charge) that 
already contain an LGD assumption, the LGD must be set to 100%.
Integrity of modelling process
7.49. Other operational requirements focus on the internal controls needed to ensure
the integrity of model inputs; specifically, the requirements address the 
transaction data, historical market data, frequency of calculation, and valuation 
models used in measuring EPE.
7.50. The internal model must reflect transaction terms and specifications in a timely,
complete, and conservative fashion. Such terms include, but are not limited to, 
contract notional amounts, maturity, reference assets, collateral thresholds, 
margining arrangements, netting arrangements, etc. The terms and specifications 
must reside in a secure database that is subject to formal and periodic audit. The 
process for recognizing netting arrangements must require signoff by legal staff 
to verify the legal enforceability of netting and be input into the database by an 
independent unit. The transmission of transaction terms and specifications data 
to the internal model must also be subject to internal audit and formal 
reconciliation processes must be in place between the internal model and source
28 Note that the recoveries may also be possible on the underlying instrument beneath such swap. The 
capital requirements for such underlying exposure are to be calculated without reduction for the swap 
which introduces wrong way risk. Generally this means that such underlying exposure will receive the 
risk weight and capital treatment associated with an unsecured transaction (i.e. assuming such 
underlying exposure is an unsecured credit exposure).

data systems to verify on an ongoing basis that transaction terms and 
specifications are being reflected in EPE correctly or at least conservatively.
7.51. When the Effective EPE model is calibrated using historic market data, the bank
must employ current market data to compute current exposures and at least three 
years of historical data must be used to estimate parameters of the model. 
Alternatively, market implied data may be used to estimate parameters of the 
model. In all cases, the data must be updated quarterly or more frequently if 
market conditions warrant. To calculate the Effective EPE using a stress 
calibration, the bank must also calibrate Effective EPE using three years of data 
that include a period of stress to the credit default spreads of a bank’s 
counterparties or calibrate Effective EPE using market implied data from a 
suitable period of stress. The following process will be used to assess the 
adequacy of the stress calibration:
(1) The bank must demonstrate, at least quarterly, that the stress period coincides
with a period of increased credit default swaps (CDS)or other credit spreads – 
such as loan or corporate bond spreads – for a representative selection of the 
bank’s counterparties with traded credit spreads. In situations where the bank 
does not have adequate credit spread data for a counterparty, the bank should 
map each counterparty to specific credit spread data based on region, internal 
rating and business types.
(2) The exposure model for all counterparties must use data, either historic or
implied, that include the data from the stressed credit period, and must use 
such data in a manner consistent with the method used for the calibration of 
the Effective EPE model to current data.
(3) To evaluate the effectiveness of its stress calibration for Effective EPE, the
bank must create several benchmark portfolios that are vulnerable to the same 
main risk factors to which the bank is exposed. The exposure to these 
benchmark portfolios shall be calculated using:
(a) current positions at current market prices, stressed volatilities, stressed
correlations and other relevant stressed exposure model inputs from the 
3-year stress period and
(b) current positions at end of stress period market prices, stressed
volatilities, stressed correlations and other relevant stressed exposure 
model inputs from the 3-year stress period. SAMA may adjust the stress 
calibration if the exposures of these benchmark portfolios deviate 
substantially.

7.52. For a bank to recognize in its EAD calculations for OTC derivatives the effect of
collateral other than cash of the same currency as the exposure itself, if it is not 
able to model collateral jointly with the exposure then it must use the standard 
supervisory haircuts of the comprehensive approach.
7.53. If the internal model includes the effect of collateral on changes in the market
value of the netting set, the bank must model collateral other than cash of the 
same currency as the exposure itself jointly with the exposure in its EAD 
calculations for securities-financing transactions.
7.54. The EPE model (and modifications made to it) must be subject to an internal
model validation process. The process must be clearly articulated in banks’ 
policies and procedures. The validation process must specify the kind of testing 
needed to ensure model integrity and identify conditions under which 
assumptions are violated and may result in an understatement of EPE. The 
validation process must include a review of the comprehensiveness of the EPE 
model, for example such as whether the EPE model covers all products that have 
a material contribution to counterparty risk exposures.
7.55. The use of an internal model to estimate EPE, and hence the exposure amount or
EAD, of positions subject to a CCR capital requirement will be conditional upon 
the explicit approval of SAMA. SAMA and relevant supervisory authorities of 
banks that carry out material trading activities in multiple jurisdictions will work 
co-operatively to ensure an efficient approval process.
7.56. SAMA will require that banks seeking to make use of internal models to estimate
EPE meet the requirements regarding, for example, the integrity of the risk 
management system, the skills of staff that will rely on such measures in 
operational areas and in control functions, the accuracy of models, and the rigour 
of internal controls over relevant internal processes. As an example, banks 
seeking to make use of an internal model to estimate EPE must demonstrate that 
they meet the general criteria for banks seeking to make use of internal models to 
assess market risk exposures, but in the context of assessing counterparty credit 
risk.29

7.57. The supervisory review process (SRP) standard of this framework provides
general background and specific guidance to cover counterparty credit risks that 
may not be fully covered by the Pillar 1 process.
7.58. No particular form of model is required to qualify to make use of an internal
model. Although this text describes an internal model as a simulation model, 
other forms of models, including analytic models, are acceptable subject to 
SAMA approval and review. Banks that seek recognition for the use of an internal 
model that is not based on simulations must demonstrate to SAMA that the model 
meets all operational requirements.
7.59. For a bank that qualifies to net transactions,
(1) The bank must have internal procedures to verify that, prior to including a
transaction in a netting set,
(2) The transaction is covered by a legally enforceable netting contract that meets
the applicable requirements of the standardized approach to counterparty 
credit risk (in Chapter 6 of this framework),  chapter 9 of the Minimum Capital 
Requirements for Credit Risk, or the Cross Product Netting Rules set forth 
7.61 to 7.71 below in this framework.
7.60. For a bank that makes use of collateral to mitigate its CCR, the bank must have
internal procedures to verify that, prior to recognizing the effect of collateral in 
its calculations, the collateral meets the appropriate legal certainty standards as 
set out in chapter 9 of the Minimum Capital Requirements for Credit Risk.
Cross-product netting rules
7.61. The Cross-Product Netting Rules apply specifically to netting across SFTs, or to
netting across both SFTs and OTC derivatives, for purposes of regulatory capital 
computation under IMM.
7.62. Banks that receive approval to estimate their exposures to CCR using the internal
models method may include within a netting set SFTs, or both SFTs and OTC 
derivatives subject to a legally valid form of bilateral netting that satisfies the 
following legal and operational criteria for a Cross-Product Netting Arrangement 
(as defined below). The bank must also have satisfied any prior approval or other 
procedural requirements that SAMA determines to implement for purposes of 
recognizing a Cross-Product Netting Arrangement.

Legal Criteria
7.63. The bank has executed a written, bilateral netting agreement with the
counterparty that creates a single legal obligation, covering all included bilateral 
master agreements and transactions (“Cross-Product Netting Arrangement”), 
such that the bank would have either a claim to receive or obligation to pay only 
the net sum of the positive and negative
(i) 
close-out values of any included individual master agreements and
(ii) 
mark-to-market values of any included individual transactions (the 
“Cross-Product Net Amount”), in the event a counterparty fails to 
perform due to any of the following: default, bankruptcy, liquidation or 
similar circumstances.
7.64. The bank has written and reasoned legal opinions that conclude with a high
degree of certainty that, in the event of a legal challenge, relevant courts or 
administrative authorities would find the bank’s exposure under the Cross 
Product Netting Arrangement to be the Cross-Product Net Amount under the laws 
of all relevant jurisdictions. In reaching this conclusion, legal opinions must 
address the validity and enforceability of the entire Cross-Product Netting 
Arrangement under its terms and the impact of the Cross-Product Netting 
Arrangement on the material provisions of any included bilateral master 
agreement.
(1) The laws of “all relevant jurisdictions” are: (i) the law of the jurisdiction in
which the counterparty is chartered and, if the foreign branch of a counterparty 
is involved, then also under the law of the jurisdiction in which the branch is 
located, (ii) the law that governs the individual transactions, and (iii) the law 
that governs any contract or agreement necessary to effect the netting.
(2) A legal opinion must be generally recognized as such by the legal community
in the bank’s home country or a memorandum of law that addresses all 
relevant issues in a reasoned manner.
7.65. The bank has internal procedures to verify that, prior to including a transaction in
a netting set, the transaction is covered by legal opinions that meet the above 
criteria.
7.66. The bank undertakes to update legal opinions as necessary to ensure continuing
enforceability of the Cross-Product Netting Arrangement in light of possible 
changes in relevant law.

7.67. The Cross-Product Netting Arrangement does not include a walkaway clause. A
walkaway clause is a provision which permits a non-defaulting counterparty to 
make only limited payments, or no payment at all, to the estate of the defaulter, 
even if the defaulter is a net creditor.
7.68. Each included bilateral master agreement and transaction included in the Cross
Product Netting Arrangement satisfies applicable legal requirements for 
recognition of credit risk mitigation techniques in credit risk mitigation 
techniques in chapter 9 of the Minimum Capital Requirements for Credit Risk.
7.69. The bank maintains all required documentation in its files.
Operational Criteria
7.70. SAMA is satisfied that the effects of a Cross-Product Netting Arrangement are
factored into the bank’s measurement of a counterparty’s aggregate credit risk 
exposure and that the bank manages its counterparty credit risk on such basis.
7.71. Credit risk to each counterparty is aggregated to arrive at a single legal exposure
across products covered by the Cross-Product Netting Arrangement. This 
aggregation must be factored into credit limit and economic capital processes.
8. Capital requirements for bank exposures to central counterparties
Scope of application
8.1. 
This chapter applies to exposures to central counterparties arising from over-the 
counter (OTC) derivatives, exchange-traded derivatives transactions, securities 
financing transactions (SFTs) and long settlement transactions. Exposures arising 
from the settlement of cash transactions (equities, fixed income, spot foreign 
exchange and spot commodities) are not subject to this treatment.30 The 
settlement of cash transactions remains subject to the treatment described in 
chapter 25 of the Minimum Capital Requirements for Credit Risk.
8.2. 
When the clearing member-to-client leg of an exchange-traded derivatives 
transaction is conducted under a bilateral agreement, both the client bank and the
30 For contributions to prepaid default funds covering settlement-risk only products, the applicable 
risk weight is 0%.

clearing member are to capitalize that transaction as an OTC derivative.31 This 
treatment also applies to transactions between lower-level clients and higher level 
clients in a multi-level client structure.
Central Counterparties
8.3. 
Regardless of whether a central counterparty (CCP) is classified as a qualifying 
CCP (QCCP), a bank retains the responsibility to ensure that it maintains 
adequate capital for its exposures. Under Pillar 2, a bank should consider whether 
it might need to hold capital in excess of the minimum capital requirements if, 
for example:
(1) its dealings with a CCP give rise to more risky exposures;  
(2) where, given the context of that bank’s dealings, it is unclear that the CCP
meets the definition of a QCCP; or
(3) an external assessment such as an International Monetary Fund Financial
Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) has found material shortcomings in the 
CCP or the regulation of CCPs, and the CCP and/or the CCP regulator have 
not since publicly addressed the issues identified.
8.4. 
Where the bank is acting as a clearing member, the bank should assess through 
appropriate scenario analysis and stress testing whether the level of capital held 
against exposures to a CCP adequately addresses the inherent risks of those 
transactions. This assessment will include potential future or contingent 
exposures resulting from future drawings on default fund commitments, and/or 
from secondary commitments to take over or replace offsetting transactions from 
clients of another clearing member in case of this clearing member defaulting or 
becoming insolvent.
8.5. 
A bank must monitor and report to senior management, the appropriate 
committee of the Board, or the delegated authority of the board on a regular basis 
all of its exposures to CCPs, including exposures arising from trading through a 
CCP and exposures arising from CCP membership obligations such as default 
fund contributions.
8.6. 
Where a bank is clearing derivative, SFT and/or long settlement transactions 
through a QCCP as defined in Chapter 4 of this framework, then paragraphs 8.7 
to 8.40 will apply. In the case of non-qualifying CCPs, paragraphs 8.41 and 8.42
31 For this purpose, the treatment in 8.12 would also apply.

will apply. Within three months of a CCP ceasing to qualify as a QCCP, unless 
SAMA requires otherwise, the trades with a former QCCP may continue to be 
capitalized as though they are with a QCCP. After that time, the bank’s exposures 
with such a CCP must be capitalized according to paragraphs 8.41 and 8.42.
Exposures to Qualifying CCPs: trade exposures 
Clearing member exposures to CCPs
8.7. 
Where a bank acts as a clearing member of a CCP for its own purposes, a risk 
weight of 2% must be applied to the bank’s trade exposure to the CCP in respect 
of OTC derivatives, exchange-traded derivative transactions, SFTs and long 
settlement transactions. Where the clearing member offers clearing services to 
clients, the 2% risk weight also applies to the clearing member’s trade exposure 
to the CCP that arises when the clearing member is obligated to reimburse the 
client for any losses suffered due to changes in the value of its transactions in the 
event that the CCP defaults. The risk weight applied to collateral posted to the 
CCP by the bank must be determined in accordance with paragraphs 8.18 to 8.23.
8.8. 
The exposure amount for a bank’s trade exposure is to be calculated in accordance 
with methods set out in the counterparty credit risk overview chapters of this 
framework (see paragraph 5.7), as consistently applied by the bank in the ordinary 
course of its business.32 In applying these methods:
(1) Provided that the netting set does not contain illiquid collateral or exotic
trades and provided there are no disputed trades, the 20-day floor for the 
margin period of risk (MPOR) established for netting sets where the 
number of trades exceeds 5000 does not apply. This floor is set out in 
6.54(1) of the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk (SA-
CCR), 9.60 of the Minimum Capital Requirements for Credit Risk of 
comprehensive approach within the standardized approach to credit risk 
and 7.24(1) of the internal models method (IMM).
(2) In all cases, a minimum MPOR of 10 days must be used for the calculation of
trade exposures to CCPs for OTC derivatives.
32 Where the firm’s internal model permission does not specifically cover centrally cleared products, 
the IMM scope would have to be extended to cover these products (even where the non-centrally 
cleared versions are included in the permission). Usually, national supervisors have a well-defined 
model approval/change process by which IMM firms can extend the products covered within their 
IMM scope. The introduction of a centrally cleared version of a product within the existing IMM 
scope must be considered as part of such a model change process, as opposed to a natural extension.

(3) Where CCPs retain variation margin against certain trades (e.g. where CCPs
collect and hold variation margin against positions in exchange-traded or OTC 
forwards), and the member collateral is not protected against the insolvency 
of the CCP, the minimum time risk horizon applied to banks’ trade exposures 
on those trades must be the lesser of one year and the remaining maturity of 
the transaction, with a floor of 10 business days.
8.9. 
The methods for calculating counterparty credit risk exposures (see 5.7), when 
applied to bilateral trading exposures (i.e. non-CCP counterparties), require banks 
to calculate exposures for each individual netting set. However, netting 
arrangements for CCPs are not as standardized as those for OTC netting 
agreements in the context of bilateral trading. As a consequence, paragraph 8.10 
below makes certain adjustments to the methods for calculating counterparty 
credit risk exposure to permit netting under certain conditions for exposures to 
CCPs.
8.10. Where settlement is legally enforceable on a net basis in an event of default and
regardless of whether the counterparty is insolvent or bankrupt, the total 
replacement cost of all contracts relevant to the trade exposure determination can 
be calculated as a net replacement cost if the applicable close-out netting sets 
meet the requirements set out in:
(1) 9.68 of the Minimum Capital Requirements for Credit Risk and, where
applicable, also 9.69 of the Minimum Capital Requirements for Credit 
Risk.
(2) 6.9 and 6.10 of the SA-CCR in this framework in the case of derivative
transactions.
(3) 7.61 to 7.71 of IMM in the case of cross-product netting.
8.11. To the extent that the rules referenced in 8.10 above include the term “master
agreement” or the phrase “a netting contract with a counterparty or other 
agreement”, this terminology must be read as including any enforceable 
arrangement that provides legally enforceable rights of set-off. If the bank cannot 
demonstrate that netting agreements meet these requirements, each single 
transaction will be regarded as a netting set of its own for the calculation of trade 
exposure.

8.12. The clearing member will always capitalize its exposure (including potential
credit valuation adjustment, or CVA, risk exposure) to clients as bilateral trades, 
irrespective of whether the clearing member guarantees the trade or acts as an 
intermediary between the client and the CCP. However, to recognize the shorter 
close-out period for cleared client transactions, clearing members can capitalize 
the exposure to their clients applying a margin period of risk of at least five days 
in IMM or SA-CCR. The reduced exposure at default (EAD) should also be used 
for the calculation of the CVA capital requirement.
8.13. If a clearing member collects collateral from a client for client cleared trades and
this collateral is passed on to the CCP, the clearing member may recognize this 
collateral for both the CCP-clearing member leg and the clearing member-client 
leg of the client-cleared trade. Therefore, initial margin posted by clients to their 
clearing member mitigates the exposure the clearing member has against these 
clients. The same treatment applies, in an analogous fashion, to multi-level client 
structures (between a higher-level client and a lower-level client).
Client exposures
8.14. Subject to the two conditions set out in 8.15 below being met, the treatment set
out in 8.7 to 8.11 (i.e. the treatment of clearing member exposures to CCPs) also 
applies to the following:
(1) A bank’s exposure to a clearing member where:
(a) the bank is a client of the clearing member; and  
(b) the transactions arise as a result of the clearing member acting as a
financial intermediary (i.e. the clearing member completes an offsetting 
transaction with a CCP).
(2) A bank’s exposure to a CCP resulting from a transaction with the CCP where:
(a) the bank is a client of a clearing member; and  
(b) the clearing member guarantees the performance the bank’s exposure
to the CCP.
(3) Exposures of lower-level clients to higher-level clients in a multi-level client
structure, provided that for all client levels in-between the two conditions in 
8.15 below are met.
8.15. The two conditions referenced in 8.14 above are:
(1) The offsetting transactions are identified by the CCP as client transactions and
collateral to support them is held by the CCP and/or the clearing member, as

applicable, under arrangements that prevent any losses to the client due to: (a) 
the default or insolvency of the clearing member; (b) the default or insolvency 
of the clearing member’s other clients; and (c) the joint default or insolvency 
of the clearing member and any of its other clients. Regarding the condition 
set out in this paragraph:
(a) Upon the insolvency of the clearing member, there must be no legal
impediment (other than the need to obtain a court order to which the 
client is entitled) to the transfer of the collateral belonging to clients of 
a defaulting clearing member to the CCP, to one or more other surviving 
clearing members or to the client or the client’s nominee. SAMA should 
be consulted to determine whether this is achieved based on particular 
facts and SAMA will consult and communicate with other supervisors.
(b) The client must have conducted a sufficient legal review (and undertake
such further review as necessary to ensure continuing enforceability) 
and have a well founded basis to conclude that, in the event of legal 
challenge, the relevant courts and administrative authorities would find 
that such arrangements mentioned above would be legal, valid, binding 
and enforceable under the relevant laws of the relevant jurisdiction(s).
(2) Relevant laws, regulation, rules, contractual, or administrative arrangements
provide that the offsetting transactions with the defaulted or insolvent clearing 
member are highly likely to continue to be indirectly transacted through the 
CCP, or by the CCP, if the clearing member defaults or becomes insolvent. In 
such circumstances, the client positions and collateral with the CCP will be 
transferred at market value unless the client requests to close out the position 
at market value. Regarding the condition set out in this paragraph, if there is a 
clear precedent for transactions being ported at a CCP and industry intent for 
this practice to continue, then these factors must be considered when assessing 
if trades are highly likely to be ported. The fact that CCP documentation does 
not prohibit client trades from being ported is not sufficient to say they are 
highly likely to be ported.
8.16. Where a client is not protected from losses in the case that the clearing member
and another client of the clearing member jointly default or become jointly 
insolvent, but all other conditions in the preceding paragraph are met, a risk 
weight of 4% will apply to the client's exposure to the clearing member, or to the 
higher-level client, respectively.

8.17. Where the bank is a client of the clearing member and the requirements in 8.14
to 8.16 above are not met, the bank will capitalize its exposure (including 
potential CVA risk exposure) to the clearing member as a bilateral trade.
Treatment of posted collateral
8.18. In all cases, any assets or collateral posted must, from the perspective of the bank
posting such collateral, receive the risk weights that otherwise applies to such 
assets or collateral under the capital adequacy framework, regardless of the fact 
that such assets have been posted as collateral. That is, collateral posted must 
receive the banking book or trading book treatment it would receive if it had not 
been posted to the CCP.
8.19. In addition to the requirements of 8.18 above, the posted assets or collateral are
subject to the counterparty credit risk requirements, regardless of whether they 
are in the banking or trading book. This includes the increase in the counterparty 
credit risk exposure due to the application of haircuts. The counterparty credit 
risk requirements arise where assets or collateral of a clearing member or client 
are posted with a CCP or a clearing member and are not held in a bankruptcy 
remote manner. In such cases, the bank posting such assets or collateral must 
recognize credit risk based upon the assets or collateral being exposed to risk of 
loss based on the creditworthiness of the entity holding such assets or collateral, 
as described further below.
8.20. Where such collateral is included in the definition of trade exposures (see Chapter
4 of this framework) and the entity holding the collateral is the CCP, the following 
risk weights apply where the assets or collateral is not held on a bankruptcy-
remote basis:
(1) For banks that are clearing members a risk weight of 2% applies.  
(2) For banks that are clients of clearing members:
(a) a 2% risk weight applies if the conditions established in 8.14 and 8.15
are met; or
(b) a 4% risk weight applies if the conditions in 8.16 are met.
8.21. Where such collateral is included in the definition of trade exposures (see Chapter
4 of this framework), there is no capital requirement for counterparty credit risk 
exposure (i.e. the related risk weight or EAD is equal to zero) if the collateral is: 
(a) held by a custodian; and (b) bankruptcy remote from the CCP. Regarding this 
paragraph:

(1) All forms of collateral are included, such as: cash, securities, other pledged
assets, and excess initial or variation margin, also called overcollateralization.
(2) The word “custodian” may include a trustee, agent, pledgee, secured creditor
or any other person that holds property in a way that does not give such person 
a beneficial interest in such property and will not result in such property being 
subject to legally-enforceable claims by such persons creditors, or to a court-
ordered stay of the return of such property, if such person becomes insolvent 
or bankrupt.
8.22. The relevant risk weight of the CCP will apply to assets or collateral posted by a
bank that do not meet the definition of trade exposures (for example treating the 
exposure as a financial institution under standardized approach or internal 
ratings-based approach to credit risk).
8.23. Regarding the calculation of the exposure, or EAD, where banks use the SA-CCR
to calculate exposures, collateral posted which is not held in a bankruptcy remote 
manner must be accounted for in the net independent collateral amount term in 
accordance with 6.17 to 6.21. For banks using IMM models, the alpha multiplier 
must be applied to the exposure on posted collateral.
Default fund exposures
8.24. Where a default fund is shared between products or types of business with
settlement risk only (e.g. equities and bonds) and products or types of business 
which give rise to counterparty credit risk i.e. OTC derivatives, exchange-traded 
derivatives, SFTs or long settlement transactions, all of the default fund 
contributions will receive the risk weight determined according to the formula 
and methodology set forth below, without apportioning to different classes or 
types of business or products. However, where the default fund contributions 
from clearing members are segregated by product types and only accessible for 
specific product types, the capital requirements for those default fund exposures 
determined according to the formulae and methodology set forth below must be 
calculated for each specific product giving rise to counterparty credit risk. In case 
the CCP’s prefunded own resources are shared among product types, the CCP 
will have to allocate those funds to each of the calculations, in proportion to the 
respective product specific EAD.

8.25. Whenever a bank is required to capitalize for exposures arising from default fund
contributions to a QCCP, clearing member banks will apply the following 
approach.
8.26. Clearing member banks will apply a risk weight to their default fund
contributions determined according to a risk sensitive formula that considers
(i) 
the size and quality of a qualifying CCP’s financial resources,
(ii) 
the counterparty credit risk exposures of such CCP, and
(iii) the application of such financial resources via the CCP’s loss-bearing
waterfall, in the case of one or more clearing member defaults. The 
clearing member bank’s risk sensitive capital requirement for its default 
fund contribution (𝐾𝐴�𝑀𝑖) must be calculated using the formulae and 
methodology set forth below.
8.27. The clearing member bank’s risk-sensitive capital requirement for its default fund
contribution (𝐾𝐴�𝑀𝑖) is calculated in two steps:
(1) Calculate the hypothetical capital requirement of the CCP due to its
counterparty credit risk exposures to all of its clearing members and their 
clients.
(2) Calculate the capital requirement for the clearing member bank.
Hypothetical capital requirement of the CCP
8.28. The first step in calculating the clearing member bank’s capital requirement for
its default fund contribution (𝐾𝐴�𝑀𝑖) is to calculate the hypothetical capital 
requirement of the CCP (𝐾𝐴�𝐴�𝑀�) due to its counterparty credit risk exposures to all 
of its clearing members and their clients. 𝐾𝐴�𝐴�𝑀� is a hypothetical capital 
requirement for a CCP, calculated on a consistent basis for the sole purpose of 
determining the capitalization of clearing member default fund contributions; it 
does not represent the actual capital requirements for a CCP which may be 
determined by a CCP and its supervisor.
8.29. K is calculated using the following formula, where: CCP
(1) RW is a risk weight of 20%33
33 The 20% risk weight is a minimum requirement. As with other parts of the capital adequacy 
framework, the national supervisor of a bank may increase the risk weight. An increase in such risk 
weight would be appropriate if, for example, the clearing members in a CCP are not highly rated. Any

(2) capital ratio is 8%  
(3) CM is the clearing member 
(4) EAD is the exposure amount of the CCP to clearing member ‘i’, relating to i
the valuation at the end of the regulatory reporting date before the margin 
called on the final margin call of that day is exchanged. The exposure includes 
both:
(a) the clearing member’s own transactions and client transactions
guaranteed by the clearing member; and
(b) all values of collateral held by the CCP (including the clearing
member’s prefunded default fund contribution) against the transactions 
in (a).
(5) The sum is over all clearing member accounts.
⋅ 𝑅𝑉� ⋅ 𝑐𝑎𝑘�𝑖𝑟�𝑎𝑘�⁡𝑟𝑎𝑟�𝑖𝑘�
𝐾𝐴�𝐴�𝑀� = ∑ 𝐴�𝐴𝐴�𝑖
𝐴�𝑀𝑖
8.30. Where clearing members provide client clearing services, and client transactions
and collateral are held in separate (individual or omnibus) sub-accounts to the 
clearing member’s proprietary business, each such client sub-account should 
enter the sum in 8.29 above separately, i.e. the member EAD in the formula above 
is then the sum of the client sub-account EADs and any house sub-account EAD. 
This will ensure that client collateral cannot be used to offset the CCP’s exposures 
to clearing members’ proprietary activity in the calculation of 𝐾𝐴�𝐴�𝑀�. If any of 
these sub-accounts contains both derivatives and SFTs, the EAD of that sub-
account is the sum of the derivative EAD and the SFT EAD.
8.31. In the case that collateral is held against an account containing both SFTs and
derivatives, the prefunded initial margin provided by the member or client must 
be allocated to the SFT and derivatives exposures in proportion to the respective 
product-specific EADs, calculated according to:
(1) Chapter 9.67 to 9.71 of the Minimum Capital Requirements for Credit Risk;
and
(2) SA-CCR (see Chapter 6 of this framework) for derivatives, without including
the effects of collateral.
8.32. If the default fund contributions of the member (𝐴�𝐴�𝑖) are not split with regard to
i client and house sub-accounts, they must be allocated per sub-account according
such increase in risk weight is to be communicated by the affected banks to the person completing this 
calculation.

to the respective fraction the initial margin of that sub-account has in relation to 
the total initial margin posted by or for the account of the clearing member.
8.33. For derivatives, 𝐴�𝐴𝐴�𝑖 is calculated as the bilateral trade exposure the CCP has i
against the clearing member using the SA-CCR. In applying the SA-CCR:
(1) A MPOR of 10 business days must be used to calculate the CCP’s potential
future exposure to its clearing members on derivatives transactions (the 20 day 
floor on the MPOR for netting sets with more than 5000 trades does not apply).
(2) All collateral held by a CCP to which that CCP has a legal claim in the event
of the default of the member or client, including default fund contributions of 
that member (𝐴�𝐴�𝑖), is used to offset the CCP’s exposure to that member or i 
client, through inclusion in the PFE multiplier in accordance with 6.23 to 6.25.
8.34. For SFTs, 𝐴�𝐴𝐴�𝑖 is equal to max(𝐴�𝐴�𝑅𝑀𝑖 − 𝐻�𝑀𝑖 − 𝐴�𝐴�𝑖; 0), where:
(1) 𝐴�𝐴�𝑅𝑀𝑖 denotes the exposure value to clearing member ‘i’ before risk
mitigation under 9.68 to 9.72 of the Minimum Capital Requirements for Credit 
Risk; where, for the purposes of this calculation, variation margin that has 
been exchanged (before the margin called on the final margin call of that day) 
enters into the mark-to-market value of the transactions.
(2) 𝐻�𝑀𝑖 is the initial margin collateral posted by the clearing member with the
CCP.
(3) 𝐴�𝐴�𝑖 is the prefunded default fund contribution by the clearing member that
will be applied upon such clearing member’s default, either along with or 
immediately following such member’s initial margin, to reduce the CCP loss.
8.35. As regards the calculation in this first step (i.e. 8.28 to 8.34):
(1) Any haircuts to be applied for SFTs must be the standard supervisory haircuts
set out in 9.44 of the Minimum Capital Requirements for Credit Risk.
(2) The holding periods for SFT calculations in 9.60 to 9.63 of the Minimum
Capital Requirements for Credit Risk.
(3) The netting sets that are applicable to regulated clearing members are the same
as those referred to in 8.10 and 8.11. For all other clearing members, they need 
to follow the netting rules as laid out by the CCP based upon notification of 
each of its clearing members. SAMA may demand more granular netting sets 
than laid out by the CCP.

8.36. The second step in calculating the clearing member bank's capital requirement
for its default fund contribution (𝐾𝐴�𝑀𝑖) is to apply the following formula,34 where:
(1) 𝐾𝐴�𝑀𝑖 is the capital requirement on the default fund contribution of clearing
member bank i
(2) 𝐴�𝐴�𝐴�𝑀𝑃𝑟𝑑�𝑑� is the total prefunded default fund contributions from clearing
members
(3) 𝐴�𝐴�𝐴�𝐴�𝑀� is the CCP's prefunded own resources (e.g. contributed capital, retained
earnings, etc.), which are contributed to the default waterfall, where these are 
junior or pari passu to prefunded member contributions
(4) 𝐴�𝐴�𝑖𝑝𝑟𝑑�𝑑� is the prefunded default fund contributions provided by clearing
member bank i
𝑘�𝑘�𝑎�𝑎�
𝐾𝐴�𝑀𝑖 = 𝑘�𝑎𝑥 (𝐾𝐴�𝐴�𝑀� ⋅ (
𝐴�𝐴�𝑖
𝑘�𝑘�𝑎�𝑎�)
𝑘�𝑘�𝑎�𝑎�) ; 8% ∗ 2% ∗ 𝐴�𝐴�𝑖
𝐴�𝐴�𝐴�𝐴�𝑀� + 𝐴�𝐴�𝐴�𝑀
8.37. The CCP, bank, CCP supervisor or other body with access to the required data,
must make a calculation of 𝐾𝐴�𝐴�𝑀�, 𝐴�𝐴�𝐴�𝑀𝑝𝑟𝑑�𝑑�, 𝐴�𝐴�𝐴�𝐴�𝑀�, in such a way to permit the 
supervisor of the CCP to oversee those calculations, and it must share sufficient 
information of the calculation results to permit each clearing member to calculate 
their capital requirement for the default fund and for SAMA to review and 
confirm such calculations.
8.38. 𝐾𝐴�𝐴�𝑀� must be calculated on a quarterly basis at a minimum; although SAMA may
require more frequent calculations in case of material changes (such as the CCP 
clearing a new product). The CCP, bank, CCP supervisor or other body that did 
the calculations must make available to SAMA the sufficient aggregate 
information about the composition of the CCP’s exposures to clearing members 
and information provided to the clearing member for the purposes of the 
calculation of 𝐾𝐴�𝐴�𝑀�, 𝐴�𝐴�𝐴�𝑀𝑝𝑟𝑑�𝑑�, 𝐴�𝐴�𝐴�𝐴�𝑀�. Such information must be provided no less 
frequently than the SAMA would require for monitoring the risk of the clearing 
member.
8.39. 𝐾𝐴�𝐴�𝑀� and 𝐾𝐴�𝑀𝑖 must be recalculated at least quarterly, and should also be
recalculated when there are material changes to the number or exposure of cleared 
transactions or material changes to the financial resources of the CCP.
34 The formula puts a floor on the default fund exposure risk weight of 2%.

Cap with regard to QCCPs
8.40. Where the sum of a bank’s capital requirements for exposures to a QCCP due to
its trade exposure and default fund contribution is higher than the total capital 
requirement that would be applied to those same exposures if the CCP were for a 
non-qualifying CCP, as outlined in 8.41 and 8.42 below, the latter total capital 
requirement shall be applied.
Exposures to non-qualifying CCPs
8.41. Banks must apply the standardized approach for credit risk, according to the
category of the counterparty, to their trade exposure to a non-qualifying CCP.
8.42. Banks must apply a risk weight of 1250% to their default fund contributions to a
non-qualifying CCP. For the purposes of this paragraph, the default fund 
contributions of such banks will include both the funded and the unfunded 
contributions which are liable to be paid if the CCP so requires. Where there is a 
liability for unfunded contributions (i.e. unlimited binding commitments), the risk 
weight shall also be 1250%. Banks may, however, seek SAMA’s approval to 
apply a different risk weight for the unfunded contributions.
9. Counterparty credit risk in the trading book
9.1. 
Banks must calculate the counterparty credit risk charge for over-the-counter 
(OTC) derivatives, repo-style and other transactions booked in the trading book, 
separate from the capital requirement for market risk.35 The risk weights to be 
used in this calculation must be consistent with those used for calculating the 
capital requirements in the banking book. Thus, banks using the standardized 
approach in the banking book will use the standardized approach risk weights in 
the trading book and banks using the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach in the 
banking book will use the IRB risk weights in the trading book in a manner 
consistent with the IRB roll-out situation in the banking book as described in 
10.44 to 10.51 of the Minimum Capital Requirements for Credit Risk. For 
counterparties included in portfolios where the IRB approach is being used the 
IRB risk weights will have to be applied.
35 The treatment for unsettled foreign exchange and securities trades is set forth in the Risk weight 
multiplier to certain exposures with currency mismatch of the individual exposures under 
standardized approach for credit risk of Basel III: Finalizing post-crisis reforms.

9.2. 
In the trading book, for repo-style transactions, all instruments, which are 
included in the trading book, may be used as eligible collateral. Those instruments 
which fall outside the banking book definition of eligible collateral shall be 
subject to a haircut at the level applicable to non-main index equities listed on 
recognized exchanges (as noted in 9.44 of the Minimum Capital Requirements 
for Credit Risk). Where banks are using a value-at-risk approach to measuring 
exposure for securities financing transactions, they also may apply this approach 
in the trading book in accordance with h 9.48 to 9.49 of the Minimum Capital 
Requirements for Credit Risk and Chapter 5 of this framework.
9.3. 
The calculation of the counterparty credit risk charge for collateralized OTC 
derivative transactions is the same as the rules prescribed for such transactions 
booked in the banking book (see Chapter 5 of this framework).
9.4. 
The calculation of the counterparty charge for repo-style transactions will be 
conducted using the rules in Chapter 5 of this framework spelt out for such 
transactions booked in the banking book. The firm-size adjustment for small or 
medium-sized entities as set out in chapter 11.9 of the Minimum Capital 
requirements for Credit Risk shall also be applicable in the trading book.
10. Minimum haircut floors for securities financing transactions
Scope
10.1. This chapter specifies the treatment of certain non-centrally cleared securities
financing transactions (SFTs) with certain counterparties. The requirements are 
not applicable to banks in jurisdictions that are prohibited from conducting such 
transactions below the minimum haircut floors specified in 10.6 below.
10.2. The haircut floors found in 10.6 below apply to the following transactions:
(1) Non-centrally cleared SFTs in which the financing (i.e. the lending of cash)
against collateral other than government securities is provided to 
counterparties who are not supervised by a regulator that imposes prudential 
requirements consistent with international norms.
(2) Collateral upgrade transactions with these same counterparties. A collateral
upgrade transaction is when a bank lends a security to its counterparty and the 
counterparty pledges a lower-quality security as collateral, thus allowing the 
counterparty to exchange a lower-quality security for a higher quality security.

For these transactions, the floors must be calculated according to the formula 
set out in 10.9 below.
10.3. SFTs with central banks are not subject to the haircut floors.
10.4. Cash-collateralized securities lending transactions are exempted from the haircut
floors where:
(1) Securities are lent (to the bank) at long maturities and the lender of securities
reinvests or employs the cash at the same or shorter maturity, therefore not 
giving rise to material maturity or liquidity mismatch.
(2) Securities are lent (to the bank) at call or at short maturities, giving rise to
liquidity risk, only if the lender of the securities reinvests the cash collateral 
into a reinvestment fund or account subject to regulations or regulatory 
guidance meeting the minimum standards for reinvestment of cash collateral 
by securities lenders set out in Section 3.1 of the Policy Framework for 
Addressing Shadow Banking Risks in Securities Lending and Repos.36 For 
this purpose, banks may rely on representations by securities lenders that their 
reinvestment of cash collateral meets the minimum standards.
10.5. Banks that borrow (or lend) securities are exempted from the haircut floors on
collateral upgrade transactions if the recipient of the securities that the bank has 
delivered as collateral (or lent) is either: (i) unable to re-use the securities (for 
example, because the securities have been provided under a pledge arrangement); 
or (ii) provides representations to the bank that they do not and will not re-use the 
securities.

scope SFTs”), expressed as percentages:

10.7. In-scope SFTs which do not meet the haircut floors must be treated as unsecured
loans to the counterparties.
10.8. To determine whether the treatment in 10.7 applies to an in-scope SFT (or a
netting set of SFTs in the case of portfolio-level haircuts), we must compare the 
collateral haircut H (real or calculated as per the rules below) and a haircut floor 
f (from 10.6 above or calculated as per the below rules).
Single in-scope SFTs
10.9. For a single in-scope SFT not included in a netting set, the values of H and f are
computed as:
(1) For a single cash-lent-for-collateral SFT, H and f are known since H is simply
defined by the amount of collateral received and f is given in 10.6.37 For the 
purposes of this calculation, collateral that is called by either counterparty can 
be treated collateral received from the moment that it is called (i.e. the 
treatment is independent of the settlement period).
(2) For a single collateral-for-collateral SFT, lending collateral A and receiving
collateral B, the H is still be defined by the amount of collateral received but 
the effective floor of the transaction must integrate the floor of the two types
37 For example, consider an in-scope SFT where 100 cash is lent against 101 of a corporate debt 
security with a 12-year maturity, H is 1% [(101- 100)/100] and f is 4% (per 10.6). Therefore, the SFT 
in question would be subject to the treatment in 10.7.

computed using the following formula,39 where:
(1) 𝐴�𝑘� is the net position in each security (or cash) s that is net lent;  
(2) 𝐴�𝑘� the net position that is net borrowed; and  
(3) 𝑐�𝑘� and  𝑐�𝑘� are the haircut floors for the securities that are net lent and net s t
borrowed respectively.

10.11. For a netting of SFTs, the portfolio does not breach the floor where:
∑ 𝐴�𝑘� − ∑ 𝐴�𝑘�
≥ 𝑐�𝑘�𝑘�𝑘�𝑘�𝑎�𝑘�𝑘�𝑖𝑘�
∑ 𝐴�𝑘�
10.12. If the portfolio haircut does breach the floor, then the netting set of SFTs is subject
to the treatment in 10.7. This treatment should be applied to all trades for which 
the security received appears in the table in 10.6 and for which, within the netting 
set, the bank is also a net receiver in that security. For the purposes of this 
calculation, collateral that is called by either counterparty can be treated collateral 
received from the moment that it is called (i.e. the treatment is independent of the 
settlement period).
10.13. The following portfolio of trades gives an example of how this methodology
works (it shows a portfolio that does not breach the floor):
38 For example, consider an in-scope SFT where 102 of a corporate debt security with a 10-year 
maturity is exchanged against 104 of equity, the effective haircut H of the transaction is 104/102 – 1 = 
1.96% which has to be compared with the effective floor f of 1.06/1.03 – 1 =2.91%. Therefore, the 
SFT in question would be subject to the treatment in 10.7. 
39 The formula calculates a weighted average floor of the portfolio.

Minimum Capital Requirements for Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA)
11. Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) Framework
Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) overview
11.1. The risk-weighted assets for Credit Value Adjustment risk are determined by
multiplying the capital requirements calculated as set out in Chapter 11 of this 
Framework by 12.5.
11.2. In the context of this framework, CVA stands for Credit Valuation Adjustment
specified at a counterparty level. CVA reflects the adjustment of default risk-free 
prices of derivatives and Securities Financing Transactions (SFTs) due to a 
potential default of the counterparty.
11.3. Unless explicitly specified otherwise, the term CVA in this framework means
regulatory CVA. Regulatory CVA may differ from CVA used for accounting 
purposes as follows:

## Page 87

(1) regulatory CVA excludes the effect of the bank’s own default; and
(2) several constraints reflecting best practice in accounting CVA are imposed on
calculations of regulatory CVA.
11.4. CVA risk is defined as the risk of losses arising from changing CVA values in
response to changes in counterparty credit spreads and market risk factors that 
drive prices of derivative transactions and SFTs.
11.5. The capital requirement for CVA risk must be calculated by all banks involved
in covered transactions in both banking book and trading book. Covered 
transactions include:
(1) all derivatives except those transacted directly with a qualified central
counterparty and except those transactions meeting the conditions of 8.14 to 
8.16 of this framework; and.
(2) SFTs that are fair-valued by a bank for accounting purposes, if SAMA
determines that the bank's CVA loss exposures arising from SFT transactions 
are material. In case the bank deems the exposures immaterial, the bank must 
justify its assessment to SAMA by providing relevant supporting 
documentation.
(3) SFTs that are fair-valued for accounting purposes and for which a bank
records zero for CVA reserves for accounting purposes are included in the 
scope of covered transactions.
11.6. The CVA risk capital requirement is calculated for a bank’s “CVA portfolio” on
a standalone basis. The CVA portfolio includes CVA for a bank’s entire portfolio 
of covered transactions and eligible CVA hedges.
11.7. Two approaches are available for calculating CVA capital: the standardized
approach (SA-CVA) and the basic approach (BA-CVA). Banks must use the BA-
CVA unless they receive approval from Saudi Central Bank (SAMA) to use the 
SA-CVA.40
11.8. Banks that have received approval of Saudi Central Bank (SAMA) to use the SA-
CVA may carve out from the SA-CVA calculations any number of netting sets. 
CVA capital for all carved out netting sets must be calculated using the BA-CVA.
40 Note that this is in contrast to the application of the market risk approaches set out in Chapter 3 of
the Minimum Capital Requirements for Market Risk, where banks do not need SAMA approval to 
use the standardized approach.

When applying the carve-out, a legal netting set may also be split into two 
synthetic netting sets, one containing the carved-out transactions subject to the 
BA-CVA and the other subject to the SA-CVA, subject to one or both of the 
following conditions:
(1) the split is consistent with the treatment of the legal netting set used by the
bank for calculating accounting CVA (e.g. where certain transactions are not 
processed by the front office/accounting exposure model); or
(2) SAMA approval to use the SA-CVA is limited and does not cover all
transactions within a legal netting set.
11.9. For banks that are below the materiality threshold where aggregate notional
amount of non-centrally cleared derivatives is less than or equal to 446 billion 
SAR may opt not to calculate its CVA capital requirements using the SA-CVA 
or BA-CVA and instead choose an alternative treatment.
(1) Subject to the above conditions and treatment,
a. Banks may choose to set its CVA capital equal to 100% of the bank’s
capital requirement for counterparty credit risk (CCR);
b. Banks CVA hedges will not be recognized; and
c. Banks must apply this treatment to the bank’s entire portfolio instead of
the BA-CVA or the SA-CVA.
(2) SAMA, however, may not allow banks to apply the above treatment if it
determines that CVA risk resulting from the bank’s derivative positions 
materially contributes to the bank’s overall risk.
11.10. Eligibility criteria for CVA hedges are specified in11.17 to 11.19 for the BA-
CVA and in 11.37 to 11.39 for the SA-CVA.
11.11. CVA hedging instruments can be external (i.e. with an external counterparty) or
internal (i.e. with one of the bank’s trading desks).
(1) 
All external CVA hedges (including both eligible and ineligible external 
CVA hedges) that are covered transactions must be included in the CVA 
calculation for the counterparty to the hedge.

(2) 
All eligible external CVA hedges must be excluded from a bank’s market 
risk capital requirement calculations under Chapter 2 through Chapter 14 
of the Minimum Capital Requirements for Market Risk.
(3) 
Ineligible external CVA hedges are treated as trading book instruments 
and are capitalized under Chapter 2 through Chapter 14 of the Minimum 
Capital Requirements for Market Risk.
(4) 
An internal CVA hedge involves two perfectly offsetting positions: one of 
the CVA desk and the opposite position of the trading desk.
a) If an internal CVA hedge is ineligible, both positions belong to the
trading book where they cancel each other, so there is no impact on 
either CVA portfolio or the trading book.
b) If an internal CVA hedge is eligible, the CVA desk’s position is part of
the CVA portfolio where it is capitalized as set out in this chapter, while 
the trading desk’s position is part of the trading book where it is 
capitalized as set out in Chapter 2 through Chapter 14 of the Minimum 
Capital Requirements for Market Risk.
(5) 
If an internal CVA hedge involves an instrument that is subject to 
curvature risk, default risk charge or the residual risk add-on under the 
standardized approach as set out in Chapter 6 to Chapter 9 of the Minimum 
Capital Requirements for Market Risk, it can be eligible only if the trading 
desk that is the CVA desk’s internal counterparty executes a transaction 
with an external counterparty that exactly offsets the trading desk’s 
position with the CVA desk.
11.12. Banks that use the BA-CVA or the SA-CVA for calculating CVA capital
requirements may cap the maturity adjustment factor at 1 for all netting sets 
contributing to CVA capital when they calculate CCR capital requirements under 
the Internal Ratings Based (IRB) approach.
Basic approach for credit valuation adjustment risk
11.13. The BA-CVA calculations may be performed either via the reduced version or
the full version. A bank under the BA-CVA approach can choose whether to 
implement the full version or the reduced version at its discretion. However, all 
banks using the BA-CVA must calculate the reduced version of BA-CVA capital

requirements as the reduced BA-CVA is also part of the full BA-CVA capital 
calculations as a conservative means to limit hedging recognition.
(1) 
The full version recognizes counterparty spread hedges and is intended for
banks that hedge CVA risk.  
(2) 
The reduced version eliminates the element of hedging recognition from
the full version. The reduced version is designed to simplify BA-CVA 
implementation for less sophisticated banks that do not hedge CVA.
Reduced version of the BA-CVA (hedges are not recognized)
11.14. The capital requirement for CVA risk under the reduced version of the BA-CVA
(𝐴�𝑅�𝐴�𝐴−𝐴�𝑅�𝐴 × 𝐾𝑘�𝑎�𝑎�𝑘�𝑎�𝑎�𝑎�, where the discount scalar 𝐴�𝑅�𝐴�𝐴−𝐴�𝑅�𝐴 = 0.65) is 
calculated as follows (where the summations are taken over all counterparties that 
are within scope of the CVA charge), where:
(1) 
𝑅�𝐴�𝑉𝐴𝐴� is the CVA capital requirement that counterparty c would receive 
if considered on a stand-alone basis (referred to as “stand-alone CVA 
capital” below). See 11.15 for its calculation;
(2) 
𝜌 = 50%. It is supervisory correlation parameter. Its square, 𝜌2 = 25% 
represents the correlation between credit spreads of any two 
counterparties.41 In the formula below, the effect of 𝑘� is to recognize the 
fact that the CVA risk to which a bank is exposed is less than the sum of 
the CVA risk for each counterparty, given that the credit spreads of 
counterparties are typically not perfectly correlated; and
(3) 
The first term under the square root in the formula below aggregates the 
systematic components of CVA risk, and the second term under the square 
root aggregates the idiosyncratic components of CVA risk.

𝐾𝑘�𝑎�𝑎�𝑘�𝑎�𝑎�𝑎� = √(𝜌 ∙ ∑ 𝑅�𝐴�𝑉𝐴𝑎�

𝐴�
41 One of the basic assumptions underlying the BA-CVA is that systematic credit spread risk is driven
by a single factor. Under this assumption, 𝜌 can be interpreted as the correlation between the credit 
spread of a counterparty and the single credit spread systematic factor.

11.15. The stand-alone CVA capital requirements for counterparty 𝑐 that are used in the
formula in 11.14  (𝑅�𝐴�𝑉𝐴𝐴�) is calculated as follows (where the summation is 
across all netting sets with the counterparty), where:
(1) 
𝑅𝑉�𝑎� is the risk weight for counterparty c that reflects the volatility of its 
credit spread. These risk weights are based on a combination of sector and 
credit quality of the counterparty as prescribed in 11.16.
(2) 
𝑀𝑀�𝑅� is the effective maturity for the netting set NS. For banks that have 
SAMA’s approval to use IMM, 𝑀𝑀�𝑅� is calculated as per 7.20 and 7.21 of 
this framework, with the exception that the five year cap in 7.20 is not 
applied. For banks that do not have SAMA’s approval to use IMM, 𝑀𝑀�𝑅� 
is calculated according to chapter 12.46 to 12.54 of the Minimum Capital 
Requirements for Credit Risk, with the exception that the five-year cap in  
chapter 12.46 of the Minimum Capital Requirements for Credit Risk is not 
applied.
(3) 
𝐴�𝐴𝐴�𝑀�𝑅� is the exposure at default (EAD) of the netting set NS, calculated 
in the same way as the bank calculates it for minimum capital 
requirements for CCR.
(4) 
𝐴�𝐴�𝑀�𝑅�is a supervisory discount factor. It is 1 for banks using the IMM to
1−𝑎�−0.05∙𝑀𝑀�𝑆
calculate EAD, and is
0.05∙𝑀𝑀�𝑆  for banks not using IMM.42
(5) 
∝= 1.4.43
𝑅�𝐴�𝑉𝐴𝑎� = 1
∝ ∙ 𝑅𝑉�𝑎� ∙ ∑ 𝑀𝑀�𝑅� ∙ 𝐴�𝐴𝐴�𝑀�𝑅� ∙ 𝐴�𝐴�𝑀�𝑅�
𝑀�𝑅�
42 DF is SAMA discount factor averaged over time between today and the netting set's effective
maturity date. The interest rate used for discounting is set at 5%, hence 0.05 in the formula. The 
product of EAD and effective maturity in the BA-CVA formula is a proxy for the area under the 
discounted expected exposure profile of the netting set. The IMM definition of effective maturity 
already includes this discount factor, hence DF is set to 1 for IMM banks. Outside IMM, netting 
set effective maturity is defined as an average of actual trade maturities. This definition lacks 
discounting, so SAMA discount factor is added to compensate for this.
43 ∝ is the multiplier used to convert Effective Expected Positive Exposure (EEPE) to EAD in both SA-
CCR and IMM. Its role in the calculation, therefore, is to convert the EAD of the netting set 
(𝐴�𝐴𝐴�𝑀�𝑅�) back to EEPE.

11.16. The supervisory risk weights (𝑅𝑉�𝑎�) are given in Table 1. Credit quality is
specified as either investment grade (IG), high yield (HY), or not rated (NR). 
Where there are no external ratings or where external ratings are not recognized 
within a jurisdiction, banks may, subject to SAMA’s approval, map the internal 
rating to an external rating and assign a risk weight corresponding to either IG or 
HY. Otherwise, the risk weights corresponding to NR is to be applied.

Full version of the BA-CVA (hedges are recognized)
11.17. As set out in 11.13(1) the full version of the BA-CVA recognizes the effect of
counterparty credit spread hedges. Only transactions used for the purpose of 
mitigating the counterparty credit spread component of CVA risk, and managed 
as such, can be eligible hedges.
11.18. Only single-name credit default swaps (CDS), single-name contingent CDS and
index CDS can be eligible CVA hedges.
11.19. Eligible single-name credit instruments must:
(1) 
reference the counterparty directly; or
(2) 
reference an entity legally related to the counterparty; where legally 
related refers to cases where the reference name and the counterparty are 
either a parent and its subsidiary or two subsidiaries of a common parent; 
or
(3) 
reference an entity that belongs to the same sector and region as the 
counterparty.
11.20. Banks that intend to use the full version of BA-CVA must calculate the reduced
version (𝐾𝑘�𝑎�𝑎�𝑘�𝑎�𝑎�𝑎�) as well. Under the full version, capital requirement for CVA 
risk 𝐴�𝑅�𝐴�𝐴−𝐴�𝑅�𝐴 × 𝐾𝑎�𝑘�𝑘�𝑘� is calculated as follows, where 𝐴�𝑅�𝐴�𝐴−𝐴�𝑅�𝐴 = 0.65, and 
𝛼� = 0.25 is the SAMA supervisory parameter that is used to provide a floor that 
limits the extent to which hedging can reduce the capital requirements for CVA 
risk:
𝐾𝑎�𝑘�𝑘�𝑘� = 𝛼� ∙ 𝐾𝑘�𝑎�𝑎�𝑘�𝑎�𝑎�𝑎� + (1 − 𝛼�) ∙ 𝐾ℎ𝑎�𝑎�𝑎�𝑎�𝑎�
11.21. The part of capital requirements that recognizes eligible hedges (𝐾ℎ𝑎�𝑎�𝑎�𝑎�𝑎�) is
calculated formulas follows (where the summations are taken over all 
counterparties c that are within scope of the CVA charge), where:
(1) 
Both the stand-alone CVA capital (SCVAc) and the correlation parameter 
(ρ) are defined in exactly the same way as for the reduced form calculation 
BA-CVA.

𝑅�𝑀�𝐻𝑎� is a quantity that gives recognition to the reduction in CVA risk of

(3) 
IH is a quantity that gives recognition to the reduction in CVA risk across 
all counterparties arising from the bank’s use of index hedges. See 11.24

(4) 
𝐻𝑀𝐴𝑎� is a quantity characterizing hedging misalignment, which is 
designed to limit the extent to which indirect hedges can reduce capital 
requirements given that they will not fully offset movements in a 
counterparty’s credit spread. That is, with indirect hedges present 
𝐾ℎ𝑎�𝑎�𝑎�𝑎�𝑎�cannot reach zero. See 11.25 for its calculation.

11.22. The formula for 𝐾ℎ𝑎�𝑎�𝑎�𝑎�𝑎� in 11.21 comprises three main terms as below:
(1) The first term (𝜌 ∙ ∑ (𝑅�𝐴�𝑉𝐴𝑎� − 𝑅�𝑀�𝐻𝑎�) − 𝐻�𝐻

)2aggregates the systematic
components of CVA risk arising from the bank’s counterparties, the single-
name hedges and the index hedges.
(2) The

term

aggregates 
the
idiosyncratic components of CVA risk arising from the bank’s counterparties 
and the single-name hedges.
(3) The third term ∑ 𝐻𝑀𝐴𝑎�
𝑎�
 aggregates the components of indirect hedges that
are not aligned with counterparties’ credit spreads.
11.23. The quantity 𝑅�𝑀�𝐻𝑎�is calculated as follows (where the summation is across all
single name hedges h that the bank has taken out to hedge the CVA risk of 
counterparty c), where:
(1) 
𝑟ℎ𝑎� is the supervisory prescribed correlation between the credit spread of 
counterparty c and the credit spread of a single-name hedge h of 
counterparty c. The value of 𝑟ℎ𝑎�⁡ is set out in the Table 2 of 11.26. It is set 
at 100% if the hedge directly references the counterparty c, and set at 
lower values if it does not.

(a) For an index where all index constituents belong to the same sector and
are of the same credit quality, the relevant value in the Table 1 of 11.16 
is multiplied by 0.7 to account for diversification of idiosyncratic risk 
within the index.
(b) For an index spanning multiple sectors or with a mixture of investment
grade constituents and other constituents, the name-weighted average 
of the risk weights from the Table 1 of 11.16 should be calculated and 
then multiplied by 0.7.

Standardized approach for credit valuation adjustment risk
11.27. The SA-CVA is an adaptation of the standardized approach for market risk set
out in Chapter 6 to Chapter 9 of the Minimum Capital Requirements for Market 
Risk. The primary differences of the SA-CVA from the standardized approach 
for market risk are:
(1) 
The SA-CVA features a reduced granularity of market risk factors; and
(2) 
The SA-CVA does not include default risk and curvature risk.
11.28. Under the SA-CVA, capital requirements must be calculated and reported to
SAMA at the same frequency as for the market risk standardized approach. In 
addition, banks using the SA-CVA must have the ability to produce SA-CVA

capital requirement calculations at the request of SAMA and must accordingly 
provide the calculations.
11.29. The SA-CVA uses as inputs the sensitivities of regulatory CVA to counterparty
credit spreads and market risk factors driving the values of covered transactions. 
Sensitivities must be computed by banks in accordance with the prudent valuation 
guidance set out in Basel Framework.
11.30. For a bank to be considered eligible for the use of SA-CVA by SAMA as set out
in 11.7 of this framework, the bank must meet the following criteria at the 
minimum.
(1) 
A bank must be able to model exposure and calculate, on at least a monthly 
basis, CVA and CVA sensitivities to the market risk factors specified in 
11.54 to 11.77 in this framework.
(2) 
A bank must have a CVA desk (or a similar dedicated function) 
responsible for risk management and hedging of CVA.
Regulatory CVA calculations
11.31. A bank must calculate regulatory CVA for each counterparty with which it has at
least one covered position for the purpose of the CVA risk capital requirements.
11.32. Regulatory CVA at a counterparty level must be calculated according to the
following principles. A bank must demonstrate its compliance to the principles 
to SAMA.
(1) 
Regulatory CVA must be calculated as the expectation of future losses 
resulting from default of the counterparty under the assumption that the 
bank itself is free from the default risk. In expressing the regulatory CVA, 
non-zero losses must have a positive sign. This is reflected in 11.52 where
ℎ𝑎�𝑎� must be subtracted from 𝑉�𝑅�𝑘
𝐴�𝑅�𝐴.
𝑉�𝑅�𝑘
(2) 
The calculation must be based on at least the following three sets of inputs:
a) term structure of market-implied probability of default (PD);  
b) market-consensus expected loss given default (ELGD);  
c) simulated paths of discounted future exposure.

(3) 
The term structure of market-implied PD must be estimated from credit 
spreads observed in the markets. For counterparties whose credit is not 
actively traded (i.e. illiquid counterparties), the market-implied PD must 
be estimated from proxy credit spreads estimated for these counterparties 
according to the following requirements:
a) A bank must estimate the credit spread curves of illiquid counterparties
from credit spreads observed in the markets of the counterparty’s liquid 
peers via an algorithm that discriminates on at least the following three 
variables: a measure of credit quality (e.g. rating), industry, and region.
b) In certain cases, mapping an illiquid counterparty to a single liquid
reference name can be allowed. A typical example would be mapping a 
municipality to its home country (i.e. setting the municipality credit 
spread equal to the sovereign credit spread plus a premium). A bank 
must justify to SAMA each case of mapping an illiquid counterparty to 
a single liquid reference name
c) When no credit spreads of any of the counterparty’s peers is available
due to the counterparty’s specific type (e.g. project finance, funds), a 
bank is allowed to use a more fundamental analysis of credit risk to 
proxy the spread of an illiquid counterparty. However, where historical 
PDs are used as part of this assessment, the resulting spread cannot be 
based on historical PD only – it must relate to credit markets.
(4) 
The market-consensus ELGD value must be the same as the one used to 
calculate the risk-neutral PD from credit spreads unless the bank can 
demonstrate that the seniority of the exposure resulting from covered 
positions differs from the seniority of senior unsecured bonds. Collateral 
provided by the counterparty does not change the seniority of the 
exposure.
(5) 
The simulated paths of discounted future exposure are produced by 
pricing all derivative transactions with the counterparty along simulated 
paths of relevant market risk factors and discounting the prices to today 
using risk-free interest rates along the path.
(6) 
All market risk factors material for the transactions with a counterparty 
must be simulated as stochastic processes for an appropriate number of

paths defined on an appropriate set of future time points extending to the 
maturity of the longest transaction.
(7) 
For transactions with a significant level of dependence between exposure 
and the counterparty’s credit quality, this dependence should be taken into 
account.
(8) 
For margined counterparties, collateral is permitted to be recognized as a 
risk mitigant under the following conditions:
a) Collateral management requirements outlined in7.39 and 7.40 in this
framework are satisfied.
b) All documentation used in collateralized transactions must be binding
on all parties and legally enforceable in all relevant jurisdictions. Banks 
must have conducted sufficient legal review to verify this and have a 
well founded legal basis to reach this conclusion, and undertake such 
further review as necessary to ensure continuing enforceability.
(9) 
For margined counterparties, the simulated paths of discounted future 
exposure must capture the effects of margining collateral that is 
recognized as a risk mitigant along each exposure path. All the relevant 
contractual features such as the nature of the margin agreement (unilateral 
vs bilateral), the frequency of margin calls, the type of collateral, 
thresholds, independent amounts, initial margins and minimum transfer 
amounts must be appropriately captured by the exposure model. To 
determine collateral available to a bank at a given exposure measurement 
time point, the exposure model must assume that the counterparty will not 
post or return any collateral within a certain time period immediately prior 
to that time point. The assumed value of this time period, known as the 
margin period of risk (MPoR), cannot be less than SAMA’s supervisory 
floor. For SFTs and client cleared transactions as specified in 8.12 in this 
framework, the supervisory floor for the MPoR is equal to 4+N business 
days, where N is the re-margining period specified in the margin 
agreement (in particular, for margin agreements with daily or intra-daily 
exchange of margin, the minimum MPoR is 5 business days). For all other 
transactions, the supervisory floor for the MPoR is equal to 9+N business 
days.

11.33. The simulated paths of discounted future exposure are obtained via the exposure
models used by a bank for calculating front office/accounting CVA, adjusted (if 
needed) to meet the requirements imposed for regulatory CVA calculation. Model 
calibration process (with the exception of the MPoR), market and transaction data 
used for regulatory CVA calculation must be the same as the ones used for 
accounting CVA calculation.
11.34. The generation of market risk factor paths underlying the exposure models must
satisfy and a bank must demonstrate to SAMA its compliance to the following 
requirements:
(1) 
Drifts of risk factors must be consistent with a risk-neutral probability 
measure. Historical calibration of drifts is not allowed.
(2) 
The volatilities and correlations of market risk factors must be calibrated 
to market data whenever sufficient data exist in a given market. Otherwise, 
historical calibration is permissible.
(3) 
The distribution of modelled risk factors must account for the possible 
non-normality of the distribution of exposures, including the existence of 
leptokurtosis (“fat tails”), where appropriate.
11.35. Netting recognition is the same as in the accounting CVA calculations. In
particular, netting uncertainty can be modelled.
11.36. A bank must satisfy and demonstrate to SAMA its compliance to the following
requirements:
(1) 
Exposure models used for calculating regulatory CVA must be part of a 
CVA risk management framework that includes the identification, 
measurement, management, approval and internal reporting of CVA risk. 
A bank must have a credible track record in using these exposure models 
for calculating CVA and CVA sensitivities to market risk factors.
(2) 
Senior management should be actively involved in the risk control process 
and must regard CVA risk control as an essential aspect of the business to 
which significant resources need to be devoted.
(3) 
A bank must have a process in place for ensuring compliance with a 
documented set of internal policies, controls and procedures concerning

the operation of the exposure system used for accounting CVA 
calculations.
(4) 
A bank must have an independent control unit that is responsible for the 
effective initial and ongoing validation of the exposure models. This unit 
must be independent from business credit and trading units (including the 
CVA desk), must be adequately staffed and must report directly to senior 
management of the bank.
(5) 
A bank must document the process for initial and ongoing validation of its 
exposure models to a level of detail that would enable a third party to 
understand how the models operate, their limitations, and their key 
assumptions; and recreate the analysis. This documentation must set out 
the minimum frequency with which ongoing validation will be conducted 
as well as other circumstances (such as a sudden change in market 
behavior) under which additional validation should be conducted. In 
addition, the documentation must describe how the validation is conducted 
with respect to data flows and portfolios, what analyses are used and how 
representative counterparty portfolios are constructed.
(6) 
The pricing models used to calculate exposure for a given path of market 
risk factors must be tested against appropriate independent benchmarks 
for a wide range of market states as part of the initial and ongoing model 
validation process. Pricing models for options must account for the non-
linearity of option value with respect to market risk factors.
(7) 
An independent review of the overall CVA risk management process 
should be carried out regularly in the bank’s own internal auditing process. 
This review should include both the activities of the CVA desk and of the 
independent risk control unit.
(8) 
A bank must define criteria on which to assess the exposure models and 
their inputs and have a written policy in place to describe the process to 
assess the performance of exposure models and remedy unacceptable 
performance.
(9) 
Exposure models must capture transaction-specific information in order to 
aggregate exposures at the level of the netting set. A bank must verify that 
transactions are assigned to the appropriate netting set within the model.

(10) 
Exposure models must reflect transaction terms and specifications in a 
timely, complete, and conservative fashion. The terms and specifications 
must reside in a secure database that is subject to formal and periodic audit. 
The transmission of transaction terms and specifications data to the 
exposure model must also be subject to internal audit, and formal 
reconciliation processes must be in place between the internal model and 
source data systems to verify on an ongoing basis that transaction terms 
and specifications are being reflected in the exposure system correctly or 
at least conservatively.
(11) 
The current and historical market data must be acquired independently of 
the lines of business and be compliant with accounting. They must be fed 
into the exposure models in a timely and complete fashion, and maintained 
in a secure database subject to formal and periodic audit. A bank must also 
have a well-developed data integrity process to handle the data of 
erroneous and/or anomalous observations. In the case where an exposure 
model relies on proxy market data, a bank must set internal policies to 
identify suitable proxies and the bank must demonstrate empirically on an 
ongoing basis that the proxy provides a conservative representation of the 
underlying risk under adverse market conditions.
Eligible hedges
11.37. Only whole transactions that are used for the purpose of mitigating CVA risk, and
managed as such, can be eligible hedges. Transactions cannot be split into several 
effective transactions.
11.38. Eligible hedges can include:
(1) 
instruments that hedge variability of the counterparty credit spread; and
(2) 
instruments that hedge variability of the exposure component of CVA risk.
11.39. Instruments that are not eligible for the internal models approach for market risk
under Chapter 10 to Chapter 13 of the Minimum Capital Requirements for Market 
Risk (e.g. tranched credit derivatives) cannot be eligible CVA hedges.
Multiplier

11.41. The multiplier 𝑘�𝐴�𝑅�𝐴is set at 1. SAMA may require a bank to use a higher value
of 𝑘�𝐴�𝑅�𝐴 if SAMA determines that the bank’s CVA model risk warrants it (e.g. if 
the level of model risk for the calculation of CVA sensitivities is too high or the 
dependence between the bank’s exposure to a counterparty and the counterparty’s 
credit quality is not appropriately taken into account in its CVA calculations).
Calculations
11.42. The SA-CVA capital requirements are calculated as the sum of the capital
requirements for delta and vega risks calculated for the entire CVA portfolio 
(including eligible hedges).
11.43. The capital requirements for delta risk are calculated as the simple sum of delta
capital requirements calculated independently for the following six risk classes:
(1) 
interest rate risk;
(2) 
foreign exchange (FX) risk;
(3) 
counterparty credit spread risk;
(4) 
reference credit spread risk (i.e. credit spreads that drive the CVA exposure
component); 
(5) 
equity risk; and
(6) 
commodity risk.
11.44. If an instrument is deemed as an eligible hedge for credit spread delta risk, it must
be assigned in its entirety (see 11.37 of this framework) either to the counterparty 
credit spread or to the reference credit spread risk class. Instruments must not be 
split between the two risk classes.
11.45. The capital requirements for vega risk are calculated as the simple sum of vega
capital requirements calculated independently for the following five risk classes. 
There is no vega capital requirements for counterparty credit spread risk.
(1) 
interest rate risk; (IR);
(2) 
FX risk;
(3) 
reference credit spread risk;
(4) 
equity risk; and

commodity risk

11.46. Delta and vega capital requirements are calculated in the same manner using the
same procedures set out in 11.47 to 11.53 of this framework.
11.47. For each risk class, (i) the sensitivity of the aggregate CVA, 𝑟�𝑘
𝐴�𝑅�𝐴, and (ii) the
sensitivity of the market value of all eligible hedging instruments in the CVA
𝐻𝑎�𝑎�, to each risk factor k in the risk class are calculated. The
portfolio, 𝑟�𝑘
sensitivities are defined as the ratio of the change of the value in question (i.e. (i) 
aggregate CVA or (ii) market value of all CVA hedges) caused by a small change 
of the risk factor’s current value to the size of the change. Specific definitions for 
each risk class are set out in 11.54 to 11.77of this framework. These definitions 
include specific values of changes or shifts in risk factors. However, a bank may 
use smaller values of risk factor shifts if doing so is consistent with internal risk 
management calculations. A bank may use AAD and similar computational 
techniques to calculate CVA sensitivities under the SA-CVA if doing so is 
consistent with the bank’s internal risk management calculations and the relevant 
validation standards described in the SA-CVA framework.
11.48. CVA sensitivities for vega risk are always material and must be calculated
regardless of whether or not the portfolio includes options. When CVA 
sensitivities for vega risk are calculated, the volatility shift must apply to both 
types of volatilities that appear in exposure models:
(1) 
volatilities used for generating risk factor paths; and
(2) 
volatilities used for pricing options.
11.49. If a hedging instrument is an index, its sensitivities to all risk factors upon which
the value of the index depends must be calculated. The index sensitivity to risk 
factor k must be calculated by applying the shift of risk factor k to all index 
constituents that depend on this risk factor and recalculating the changed value of 
the index. For example, to calculate delta sensitivity of S&P500 to large financial 
companies, a bank must apply the relevant shift to equity prices of all large 
financial companies that are constituents of S&P500 and re-compute the index.
11.50. For the following risk classes, a bank may choose to introduce a set of additional
risk factors that directly correspond to qualified credit and equity indices. For 
delta risks, a credit or equity index is qualified if it satisfies liquidity and 
diversification conditions specified in Chapter 7.31 of the Minimum Capital 
Requirements for Market Risk; for vega risks, any credit or equity index is

qualified. Under this option, a bank must calculate sensitivities of CVA and the 
eligible CVA hedges to the qualified index risk factors in addition to sensitivities 
to the non-index risk factors. Under this option, for a covered transaction or an 
eligible hedging instrument whose underlying is a qualified index, its contribution 
to sensitivities to the index constituents is replaced with its contribution to a single 
sensitivity to the underlying index. For example, for a portfolio consisting only 
of equity derivatives referencing only qualified equity indices, no calculation of 
CVA sensitivities to non-index equity risk factors is necessary. If more than 75% 
of constituents of a qualified index (taking into account the weightings of the 
constituents) are mapped to the same sector, the entire index must be mapped to 
that sector and treated as a single-name sensitivity in that bucket. In all other 
cases, the sensitivity must be mapped to the applicable index bucket.

counterparty credit spread risk;
(2) 
reference credit spread risk; and
(3) 
equity risk.
11.51. The weighted sensitivities 𝑉�𝑅�𝑘
𝐻𝑎�𝑎� for each risk factor k are calculated
𝐴�𝑅�𝐴 and 𝑉�𝑅�𝑘
𝐻𝑎�𝑎�, respectively, by the
by multiplying the net sensitivities 𝑅�𝑘

11.52. The net weighted sensitivity of the CVA portfolio 𝑅�𝐾 to risk factor k is obtained
by44:
44 Note that the formula in 11.52 is set out under the convention that the CVA is positive as specified 
in 11.32 (1). It intends to recognize the risk reducing effect of hedging. For example, when hedging 
the counterparty credit spread component of CVA risk for a specific counterparty by buying credit 
protection on the counterparty: if the counterparty’s credit spread widens, the CVA (expressed as a 
positive value) increases resulting in the positive CVA sensitivity to the counterparty credit spread. At 
the same time, as the value of the hedge from the bank’s perspective increases as well (as credit 
protection becomes more valuable), the sensitivity of the hedge is also positive. The positive weighted 
sensitivities of the CVA and its hedge offset each other using the formula with the minus sign. If CVA 
loss had been expressed as a negative value, the minus sign in 11.52 would have been replaced by a 
plus sign.

11.53. For each risk class, the net sensitivities are aggregated as follows:

within each bucket b (the buckets and correlation parameters 𝜌𝐾𝑘� applicable 
to each risk class are specified in 11.54 to 11.77 of this framework), where R

11.55. For interest rate delta and vega risks, cross-bucket correlation 𝛼�𝑎�𝑎� is set at 0.5 for
all currency pairs.
11.56. The interest rate delta risk factors for a bank’s reporting currency and for the
following currencies USD, EUR, GBP, AUD, CAD, SEK or JPY:
(1) 
The interest rate delta risk factors are the absolute changes of the inflation 
rate and of the risk-free yields for the following five tenors: 1 year, 2 years, 
5 years, 10 years and 30 years.
(2) 
The sensitivities to the abovementioned risk-free yields are measured by 
changing the risk-free yield for a given tenor for all curves in a given 
currency by 1 basis point (0.0001 in absolute terms) and dividing the 
resulting change in the aggregate CVA (or the value of CVA hedges) by 
0.0001. The sensitivity to the inflation rate is obtained by changing the 
inflation rate by 1 basis point (0.0001 in absolute terms) and dividing the 
resulting change in the aggregate CVA (or the value of CVA hedges) by 
0.0001.

11.57. The interest rate delta risk factors for other currencies not specified in 11.56 of
this framework:
(1) 
The interest rate risk factors are the absolute change of the inflation rate 
and the parallel shift of the entire risk-free yield curve for a given currency.
(2) 
The sensitivity to the yield curve is measured by applying a parallel shift 
to all risk-free yield curves in a given currency by 1 basis point (0.0001 in 
absolute terms) and dividing the resulting change in the aggregate CVA 
(or the value of CVA hedges) by 0.0001. The sensitivity to the inflation 
rate is obtained by changing the inflation rate by 1 basis point (0.0001 in 
absolute terms) and dividing the resulting change in the aggregate CVA 
(or the value of CVA hedges) by 0.0001.
(3) 
The risk weights for both the risk-free yield curve and the inflation rate 
𝑅𝑉�𝑘 are set at 1.85%.
(4) 
The correlations between the risk-free yield curve and the inflation rate 
𝜌𝐾𝑘� are set at 40%.
11.58. The interest rate vega risk factors for all currencies:
(1) 
The interest rate vega risk factors are a simultaneous relative change of all 
volatilities for the inflation rate and a simultaneous relative change of all 
interest rate volatilities for a given currency.
(2) 
The sensitivity to (i) the interest rate volatilities or (ii) inflation rate 
volatilities is measured by respectively applying a simultaneous shift to (i)

11.60. For FX delta and vega risks, the cross-bucket correlation 𝛼�𝑎�𝑎� is set at 06. for all
currency pairs.
11.61. The FX delta risk factors for all currencies:
(1) The single FX delta risk factor is defined as the relative change of the FX spot
rate between a given currency and a bank’s reporting currency, where the FX 
spot rate is the current market price of one unit of another currency expressed 
in the units of the bank’s reporting currency.
(2) Sensitivities to FX spot rates are measured by shifting the exchange rate
between the bank’s reporting currency and another currency (i.e. the value of 
one unit of another currency expressed in units of the reporting currency) by 
1% relative to its current value and dividing the resulting change in the 
aggregate CVA (or the value of CVA hedges) by 0.01. For transactions that 
reference an exchange rate between a pair of non-reporting currencies, the 
sensitivities to the FX spot rates between the bank’s reporting currency and 
each of the referenced non-reporting currencies must be measured.45
(3) The risk weights for all exchange rates between the bank’s reporting currency
and another currency are set at 11%.
45 For example, if a SAR-reporting bank holds an instrument that references the USD-GBP exchange 
rate, the bank must measure CVA sensitivity both to the SAR-GBP exchange rate and to the SAR-
USD exchange rate.

11.62. The FX vega risk factors for all currency:
(1) 
The single FX vega risk factor is a simultaneous relative change of all 
volatilities for an exchange rate between a bank’s reporting currency and 
another given currency.
(2) 
The sensitivities to the FX volatilities are measured by simultaneously 
shifting all volatilities for a given exchange rate between the bank’s 
reporting currency and another currency by 1% relative to their current 
values and dividing the resulting change in the aggregate CVA (or the 
value of CVA hedges) by 0.01.  For transactions that reference an 
exchange rate between a pair of non-reporting currencies, the volatilities 
of the FX spot rates between the bank’s reporting currency and each of the 
referenced non-reporting currencies must be measured.
(3) 
The risk weights for FX volatilities 𝑅𝑉�𝑘 are set to 100%.
Counterparty credit spread buckets, risk factors, sensitivities, risk weights and 
correlations
11.63. Counterparty credit spread risk is not subject to vega risk capital requirements.
Buckets for delta risk are set as follows:
(1) 
Buckets 1 to 7 are defined for factors that are not qualified indices as set 
out in 11.50 of this framework;
(2) 
Bucket 8 is set for the optional treatment of qualified indices. Under the 
optional treatment, only instruments that reference qualified indices can 
be assigned to bucket 8, while all single-name and all non-qualified index 
hedges must be assigned to buckets 1 to 7 for calculations of CVA 
sensitivities and sensitivities. For any instrument referencing an index 
assigned to buckets 1 to 7, the look-through approach must be used (i.e., 
sensitivity of the hedge to each index constituent must be calculated).

11.65. The counterparty credit spread delta risk factors for a given bucket:
(1) 
The counterparty credit spread delta risk factors are absolute shifts of 
credit spreads of individual entities (counterparties and reference names 
for counterparty credit spread hedges) and qualified indices (if the optional 
treatment is chosen) for the following tenors: 0.5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 
years and 10 years.
(2) 
For each entity and each tenor point, the sensitivities are measured by 
shifting the relevant credit spread by 1 basis point (0.0001 in absolute 
terms) and dividing the resulting change in the aggregate CVA (or the 
value of CVA hedges) by 0.0001.
(3) 
The risk weights 𝑅𝑉�𝑘 are set as follows the depending on the entity’s 
bucket, where IG, HY, and NR represent “investment grade”, “high yield” 
and “not rated”  as specified for the BA-CVA in 11.16 of this framework. 
The same risk weight for a given bucket and given credit quality applies 
to all tenors.

Equity buckets, risk factors, sensitivities, risk weights and correlations
11.70. For equity delta and vega risks, buckets are set as follow, where:
(1) 
Market capitalization (“market cap”) is defined as the sum of the market 
capitalizations of the same legal entity or group of legal entities across all 
stock markets globally. The reference to “group of legal entities” covers 
cases where the listed entity is a parent company of a group of legal 
entities. Under no circumstances should the sum of the market 
capitalizations of multiple related listed entities be used to determine 
whether a listed entity is “large market cap” or “small market cap”.
(2) 
“Large market cap” is defined as a market capitalization equal to or greater 
than USD 2 billion and “small market cap” is defined as a market 
capitalization of less than USD 2 billion.
(3) 
The advanced economies are Canada, the United States, Mexico, the euro 
area, the non-euro area western European countries (the United Kingdom, 
Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Switzerland), Japan, Oceania (Australia 
and New Zealand), Singapore and Hong Kong SAR.
(4) 
To assign a risk exposure to a sector, banks must rely on a classification 
that is commonly used in the market for grouping issuers by industry 
sector. The bank must assign each issuer to one of the sector buckets in 
the table above and it must assign all issuers from the same industry to the 
same sector. Risk positions from any issuer that a bank cannot assign to a 
sector in this fashion must be assigned to the “other sector” (i.e. bucket 
11). For multinational multi-sector equity issuers, the allocation to a 
particular bucket must be done according to the most material region and 
sector in which the issuer operates.

Application Guidance/ Illustrative examples
12. The application of the (SA-CCR) to sample portfolios
12.1. This section sets out the calculation of exposure at default (EAD) for five sample
portfolios using SA-CCR. The calculations for the sample portfolios assume that 
intermediate values are not rounded (i.e. the actual results are carried through in 
sequential order). However, for ease of presentation, these intermediate values as 
well as the final EAD are rounded.
12.2. The EAD for all netting sets in SA-CCR is given by the following formula, where
alpha is assigned a value of 1.4:
𝐴�𝐴𝐴� = 𝑎𝑘�𝑘�ℎ𝑎 ∗ (𝑅𝐴� + 𝑘�𝑟�𝑘�𝑟�𝑖𝑘�𝑘�𝑖𝑐�𝑟 ∗ 𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝑎𝑎�𝑎�𝑘�𝑎�𝑎�𝑎𝑘�𝑎�
Example 1: Interest rate derivatives (unmargined netting set)
12.3. Netting set 1 consists of three interest rates derivatives: two fixed versus floating
interest rate swaps and one purchased physically-settled European swaption. The 
table below summarizes the relevant contractual terms of the three derivatives. 
All notional amounts and market values in the table are given in USD thousands.

collateral (independent amount/initial margin) at inception. For unmargined 
netting sets, the replacement cost is calculated using the following formula,

(1) V is a simple algebraic sum of the derivatives’ market values at the reference
date
(2) C is the haircut value of the initial margin, which is zero in this example
𝑅𝐴� = max⁡{𝑉 − 𝐴�; 0}
12.5. Thus, using the market values indicated in the table (expressed in USD
thousands):
𝑅𝐴� = max{30 − 20 + 50 − 0; 0} = 60
12.6. Since V-C is positive (i.e. USD 60,000), the value of the multiplier is 1, as
explained in 6.24.
12.7. The remaining term to be calculated in the calculation EAD is the aggregate add-
on (𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝑎𝑎�𝑎�𝑘�𝑎�𝑎�𝑎𝑘�𝑎�). All the transactions in the netting set belong to the interest 
rate asset class. The 𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝑎𝑎�𝑎�𝑘�𝑎�𝑎�𝑎𝑘�𝑎� for the interest rate asset class can be 
calculated using the seven steps set out in 6.60.
12.8. Step 1: Calculate the effective notional for each trade in the netting set. This is
calculated as the product of the following three terms:
(i) 
the adjusted notional of the trade (d);
(ii) 
the supervisory delta adjustment of the trade (δ); and
(iii) the maturity factor (MF). That is, for each trade i, the effective notional
Di is calculated as 𝐴�𝑖 = 𝑐�𝑖 ∗ 𝑀𝐴�𝑖 ∗ 𝛼�.
12.9. For interest rate derivatives, the trade-level adjusted notional (𝑐�𝑖) is the product
of the trade notional amount and the supervisory duration (𝑅�𝐴�𝑖), i.e. 𝑐�𝑖 =
𝑘�𝑘�𝑟�𝑖𝑘�𝑘�𝑎𝑘� ∗ 𝑅�𝐴�𝑖. The supervisory duration is calculated using the following 
formula, where:
(1) 𝑅�𝑖 and 𝐴�𝑖 are the start and end dates, respectively, of the time period referenced
by the interest rate derivative (or, where such a derivative references the value 
of another interest rate instrument, the time period determined on the basis of 
the underlying instrument). If the start date has occurred (e.g. an ongoing 
interest rate swap), 𝑅�𝑖 must be set to zero.
(2) The calculated value of 𝑅�𝐴�𝑖 is floored at 10 business days (which expressed
in years, using an assumed market convention of 250 business days a year is 
10/250 years

notional amounts for each of the trades in Example 1 are as follows:

12.11. 6.51 sets out the calculation of the maturity factor (𝑀𝐴�𝑖) for unmargined trades.
For trades that have a remaining maturity in excess of one year, which is the case 
for all trades in this example, the formula gives a maturity factor of 1.
12.12. As set out in 6.40 to 6.43, a supervisory delta is assigned to each trade. In
particular:
(1) Trade 1 is long in the primary risk factor (the reference floating rate) and is
not an option so the supervisory delta is equal to 1.
(2) Trade 2 is short in the primary risk factor and is not an option; thus, the
supervisory delta is equal to -1.
(3) Trade 3 is an option to enter into an interest rate swap that is short in the
primary risk factor and therefore is treated as a bought put option. As such, 
the supervisory delta is determined by applying the relevant formula in 6.42, 
using 50% as the supervisory option volatility and 1 (year) as the option 
exercise date. In particular, assuming that the underlying price (the appropriate 
forward swap rate) is 6% and the strike price (the swaption’s fixed rate) is 5%, 
the supervisory delta is:
ln (0.06
0.05) + 0.05 ∙ 0.052 ∙ 1

12.13. The effective notional for each trade in the netting set (𝐴�𝑖) is calculated using the
formula 𝐴�𝑖 = 𝑐�𝑖 ∗ 𝑀𝐴�𝑖 ∗ 𝛼�𝑖 and values for each term noted above. The results of 
applying the formula are as follows:

12.14. Step 2: Allocate the trades to hedging sets. In the interest rate asset class the
hedging sets consist of all the derivatives that reference the same currency. In this 
example, the netting set is comprised of two hedging sets, since the trades refer 
to interest rates denominated in two different currencies (USD and EUR).
12.15. Step 3: Within each hedging set allocate each of the trades to the following three
maturity buckets: less than one year (bucket 1), between one and five years 
(bucket 2) and more than five years (bucket 3). For this example, within the 
hedging set “USD”, trade 1 falls into the third maturity bucket (more than 5 years) 
and trade 2 falls into the second maturity bucket (between one and five years). 
Trade 3 falls into the third maturity bucket (more than 5 years) of the hedging set 
“EUR”. The results of steps 1 to 3 are summarized in the table below:

level effective notionals within each maturity bucket in the hedging set. In this 
example, there are no maturity buckets within a hedging set with more than one 
trade, and so this case the effective notional of each maturity bucket is simply 
equal to the effective notional of the single trade in each bucket. Specifically:
(1) For the USD hedging set: 𝐴�𝐴�1is zero, 𝐴�𝐴�2 is -36,254 (thousand USD) and 𝐴�𝐴�3
is 78,694 (thousand USD)
(2) For the EUR hedging set: 𝐴�𝐴�1 and 𝐴�𝐴�2 are zero and 𝐴�𝐴�3 is -10,083 (thousand
USD).
12.17. Step 5: Calculate the effective notional of the hedging set (𝐴�𝑀�𝐻𝑅�) by using either
of the two following aggregation formulas (the latter is to be used if the bank 
chooses not to recognize offsets between long and short positions across maturity 
buckets):
Offset formula: 
𝐴�𝑀�ℎ𝑘� = [(𝐴�𝐴�1)2 + (𝐴�𝐴�2)2 + (𝐴�𝐴�3)2 + 1.4 ∗ 𝐴�𝐴�1 ∗ 𝐴�𝐴�2 + 1.4 ∗ 𝐴�𝐴�2 ∗
1
2
𝐴�𝐴�3 + 0.6 ∗ 𝐴�𝐴�1 ∗ 𝐴�𝐴�3]
No offset formula: 𝐴�𝑀�ℎ𝑘� = |𝐴�𝐴�1| + |𝐴�𝐴�2| + |𝐴�𝐴�3|
12.18. In this example, the first of the two aggregation formulas is used. Therefore, the
effective notionals for the USD hedging set (𝐴�𝑀�𝑅�𝑅�𝐴�) and the EUR hedging 
(𝐴�𝑀�𝐴�𝑅�𝑅) are, respectively (expressed in USD thousands):
1
2 = 59,270
𝐴�𝑀�𝑅�𝑅�𝐴� = [(−36,254)2 + (78,694)2 + 1.4 ∗ (−36,254) ∗ 78,694]
1
2 = 10,083
𝐴�𝑀�𝐴�𝑅�𝑅 = [(−10,083)2]
12.19. Step 6: Calculate the hedging set level add-on (𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�ℎ𝑘�) by multiplying the
effective notional of the hedging set (𝐴�𝑀�ℎ𝑘�) by the prescribed supervisory factor 
(𝑅�𝐴�ℎ𝑘�). The prescribed supervisory factor in the interest rate asset class is set at 
0.5%. Therefore, the add-on for the USD and EUR hedging sets are, respectively 
(expressed in USD thousands):
𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝑅�𝑅�𝐴� = 59,270 ∗ 0.005 = 296.35
𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝐴�𝑅�𝑅 = 10,083 ∗ 0.005 = 50.415

12.20. Step 7: Calculate the asset class level add-on (𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝐻�𝑅) by adding together all
of the hedging set level add-ons calculated in step 6. Therefore, the add-on for 
the interest rate asset class is (expressed in USD thousands):
𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝐻�𝑅 = 296.35 + 50.415 = 347
12.21. For this netting set the interest rate add-on is also the aggregate add-on because
there are no derivatives belonging to other asset classes. The EAD for the netting 
set can now be calculated using the formula set out in 12.2 (expressed in USD 
thousands):
𝐴�𝐴𝐴� = 𝑎𝑘�𝑘�ℎ𝑎 ∗ (𝑅𝐴� + 𝑘�𝑟�𝑘�𝑟�𝑖𝑘�; 𝑖𝑐�𝑟 ∗ 𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝑎𝑎�𝑎�𝑘�𝑎�𝑎�𝑎𝑘�𝑎�) = 1.4 ∗ (60 + 1 ∗ 347) = 569
Example 2: Credit derivatives (unmargined netting set)
12.22. Netting set 2 consists of three credit derivatives: one long single-name credit
default swap (CDS) written on Firm A (rated AA), one short single-name CDS 
written on Firm B (rated BBB), and one long CDS index (investment grade). The 
table below summarizes the relevant contractual terms of the three derivatives.

12.23. As in the previous example, the netting set is not subject to a margin agreement
and there is no exchange of collateral (independent amount/IM) at inception. For 
unmargined netting sets, the replacement cost is calculated using the following 
formula, where:

(1) V is a simple algebraic sum of the derivatives’ market values at the reference
date
(2) C is the haircut value of the IM, which is zero in this example
𝑅𝐴� = 𝑘�𝑎𝑥{𝑉 − 𝐴�; 0}
12.24. Thus, using the market values indicated in the table (expressed in USD
thousands):
𝑅𝐴� = 𝑘�𝑎𝑥{20 − 40 + 0 − 0; 0} = 0
12.25. Since in this example V-C is negative (equal to V, i.e. -20,000), the multiplier
will be activated (i.e. it will be less than 1). Before calculating its value, the 
aggregate add-on (𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝑎𝑎�𝑎�𝑘�𝑎�𝑎�𝑎𝑘�𝑎�) needs to be determined.
12.26. All the transactions in the netting set belong to the credit derivatives asset class.
The 𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝑎𝑎�𝑎�𝑘�𝑎�𝑎�𝑎𝑘�𝑎� for the credit derivatives asset class can be calculated using 
the four steps set out in 6.64.
12.27. Step 1: Calculate the effective notional for each trade in the netting set. This is
calculated as the product of the following three terms: (i) the adjusted notional of 
the trade (d); (ii) the supervisory delta adjustment of the trade (δ); and (iii) the 
maturity factor (MF). That is, for each trade i, the effective notional Di is 
calculated as 𝐴�𝑖 = 𝑐�𝑖 ∗ 𝑀𝐴�𝑖 ∗ 𝛼�𝑖.
12.28. For credit derivatives, like interest rate derivatives, the trade-level adjusted
notional (𝑐�𝑖) is the product of the trade notional amount and the supervisory 
duration (𝑅�𝐴�𝑖), i.e. 𝑐�𝑖 = 𝑘�𝑘�𝑟�𝑖𝑘�𝑘�𝑎𝑘� ∗ 𝑅�𝐴�𝑖. The trade-level adjusted notional 
amounts for each of the trades in Example 2 are as follows:

12.29. 6.51 sets out the calculation of the maturity factor (𝑀𝐴�𝑖) for unmargined trades.
For trades that have a remaining maturity in excess of one year, which is the case 
for all trades in this example, the formula gives a maturity factor of 1.
12.30. As set out in 6.40 to 6.43, a supervisory delta is assigned to each trade. In
particular:
(1) Trade 1 and Trade 3 are long in the primary risk factors (CDS spread) and are
not options so the supervisory delta is equal to 1 for each trade.
(2) Trade 2 is short in the primary risk factor and is not an option; thus, the
supervisory delta is equal to -1.
12.31. The effective notional for each trade in the netting set (𝐴�𝑖) is calculated using the
formula 𝐴�𝑖 = 𝑐�𝑖 ∗ 𝑀𝐴�𝑖 ∗ 𝛼�𝑖 and values for each term noted above. The results of 
applying the formula are as follows:

12.32. Step 2: Calculate the combined effective notional for all derivatives that reference
the same entity. The combined effective notional of the entity (𝐴�𝑀�𝑎�𝑘�𝑘�𝑖𝑘�𝑦) is 
calculated by adding together the trade level effective notionals calculated in step 
1 that reference that entity. However, since all the derivatives refer to different 
entities (single names/indices), the effective notional of the entity is simply equal 
to the trade level effective notional (𝐴�𝑖) for each trade.
12.33. Step 3: Calculate the add-on for each entity (𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝑎�𝑘�𝑘�𝑖𝑘�𝑦) by multiplying the
entity level effective notional in step 2 by the supervisory factor that is specified 
for that entity (𝑅�𝐴�𝑎�𝑘�𝑘�𝑖𝑘�𝑦). The supervisory factors are set out in table 2 in 6.75. A 
supervisory factor is assigned to each single-name entity based on the rating of 
the reference entity (0.38% for AA-rated firms and 0.54% for BBB-rated firms).

For CDS indices, the SF is assigned according to whether the index is investment

(1) The summations are across all entities referenced by the derivatives.
(2) 𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝑎�𝑘�𝑘�𝑖𝑘�𝑦 is the add-on amount calculated in step 3 for each entity

(3) 𝜌𝑎�𝑘�𝑘�𝑖𝑘�𝑦 is the supervisory prescribed correlation factor corresponding to the

12.36. According to the calculations in the table, the systematic component is 2,253,
while the idiosyncratic component is 77,344. Thus, the add-on for the credit asset 
class is calculated as follows:
1
2 = 282
𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝑎�𝑘�𝑎�𝑎�𝑖𝑘� = [2,253 + 77,344]
12.37. For this netting set the credit add-on (𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝑎�𝑘�𝑎�𝑎�𝑖𝑘�) is also the aggregate add-on
(𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝑎𝑎�𝑎�𝑘�𝑎�𝑎�𝑎𝑘�𝑎�) because there are no derivatives belonging to other asset 
classes.
12.38. The value of the multiplier can now be calculated as follows, using the formula
set out in 6.25:
𝑘�𝑟�𝑘�𝑟�𝑖𝑘�𝑘�𝑖𝑐�𝑟 = 𝑘�𝑖𝑘� {1; 0.05 + 0.95 ∗ 𝑐�𝑥𝑘� (
−20
2 ∗ 0.95 ∗ 282)} = 0.965
12.39. Finally, aggregating the replacement cost and the potential future exposure (PFE)
component and multiplying the result by the alpha factor of 1.4, the EAD is as 
follows (USD thousands):
𝐴�𝐴𝐴� = 1.4 ∗ (0 + 0.965 ∗ 282) = 381

12.41. As in the previous two examples, the netting set is not subject to a margin
agreement and there is no exchange of collateral (independent amount/IM) at 
inception. Thus, the replacement cost is given by:
𝑅𝐴� = 𝑘�𝑎𝑥{𝑉 − 𝐴�; 0} = 𝑘�𝑎𝑥{100 − 30 − 50 − 0; 0} = 20
12.42. Since V-C is positive (i.e. USD 20,000), the value of the multiplier is 1, as
explained in 6.24.
12.43. All the transactions in the netting set belong to the commodities derivatives asset
class. The 𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝑎𝑎�𝑎�𝑘�𝑎�𝑎�𝑎𝑘�𝑎� for the commodities derivatives asset class can be 
calculated using the six steps set out in 6.72.
12.44. Step 1: Calculate the effective notional for each trade in the netting set. This is
calculated as the product of the following three terms: (i) the adjusted notional of 
the trade (d); (ii) the supervisory delta adjustment of the trade (δ); and (iii) the 
maturity factor (MF). That is, for each trade i, the effective notional 𝐴�𝑖D is 
calculated as 𝐴�𝑖 = 𝑐�𝑖 ∗ 𝑀𝐴�𝑖 ∗ 𝛼�𝑖.
12.45. For commodity derivatives, the adjusted notional is defined as the product of the
current price of one unit of the commodity (e.g. barrel of oil) and the number of 
units referenced by the derivative. In this example, for the sake of simplicity, it is 
assumed that the adjusted notional (𝑐�𝑖) is equal to the notional value.
12.46. 6.51 sets out the calculation of the maturity factor (𝑀𝐴�𝑖) for unmargined trades.
For trades that have a remaining maturity in excess of one year (trades 2 and 3 in 
this example), the formula gives a maturity factor of 1. For trade 1 the formula 
gives the following maturity factor:

12.47. As set out in 6.40 to 6.43, a supervisory delta is assigned to each trade. In
particular:
(1) Trade 1 and Trade 3 are long in the primary risk factors (WTI Crude Oil and
Silver respectively) and are not options so the supervisory delta is equal to 1 
for each trade.
(2) Trade 2 is short in the primary risk factor (Brent Crude Oil) and is not an
option; thus, the supervisory delta is equal to -1.

12.48. Step 2: Allocate the trades in commodities asset class to hedging sets. In the
commodities asset class there are four hedging sets consisting of derivatives that 
reference: energy (trades 1 and 2 in this example), metals (trade 3 in this 
example), agriculture and other commodities.

12.49. Step 3: Calculate the combined effective notional for all derivatives with each
hedging set that reference the same commodity type. The combined effective 
notional of the commodity type (𝐴�𝑀�𝐴�𝑘�𝑘�𝑅�𝑦𝑘�𝑎�) is calculated by adding together the 
trade level effective notionals calculated in step 1 that reference that commodity 
type. For purposes of this calculation, the bank can ignore the basis difference 
between the WTI and Brent forward contracts since they belong to the same 
commodity type, “Crude Oil” (unless the national supervisor requires the bank to 
use a more refined definition of commodity types). This step gives the following:
(1) 𝐴�𝑀�𝐴�𝑘�𝑘�𝑎�𝑎�𝑀�𝑖𝑘� = ⁡8,660⁡ +⁡(−20,000)⁡=⁡−11,340  
(2) 𝐴�𝑀�𝑅�𝑖𝑘�𝑘�𝑎�𝑘� = ⁡10,000
12.50. Step 4: Calculate the add-on for each commodity type (𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝐴�𝑘�𝑘�𝑅�𝑦𝑘�𝑎�) within
each hedging set by multiplying the combined effective notional for that 
commodity calculated in step 3 by the supervisory factor that is specified for that 
commodity type (𝑅�𝐴�𝐴�𝑘�𝑘�𝑅�𝑦𝑘�𝑎�). The supervisory factors are set out in table 2 in 
6.75 and are set at 40% for electricity derivatives and 18% for derivatives that 
reference all other types of commodities. Therefore:
(1) 𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝐴�𝑘�𝑘�𝑎�𝑎�𝑀�𝑖𝑘� = -11,340 * 0.18 = -2,041
(2) 𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝑅�𝑖𝑘�𝑘�𝑎�𝑘�= 10,000 * 0.18 = 1,800

12.51. Step 5: Calculate the add-on for each of the four commodity hedging sets
(𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝐻𝑅�) by using the formula that follows. In the formula:
(1) The summations are across all commodity types within the hedging set. 
(2) 𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝐴�𝑘�𝑘�𝑅�𝑦𝑘�𝑎� is the add-on amount calculated in step 4 for each commodity
type.
(3) 𝜌𝐴�𝑘�𝑘�𝑅�𝑦𝑘�𝑎� is the supervisory prescribed correlation factor corresponding to the
commodity type. As set out in Table 2 in 6.75, the correlation factor is set at 
40% for all commodity types.

𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝐻𝑅� = [(

12.52. In this example, however, there is only one commodity type within the “Energy”
hedging set (ie Crude Oil). All other commodity types within the energy hedging 
set (eg coal, natural gas etc) have a zero add-on. Therefore, the add-on for the 
energy hedging set is calculated as follows:
𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝐴�𝑘�𝑎�𝑘�𝑎�𝑦 = [(𝜌𝐴�𝑘�𝑘�𝑎�𝑎�𝑀�𝑖𝑘� ∗⁡𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝐴�𝑘�𝑘�𝑎�𝑎�𝑀�𝑖𝑘�)2 + (1 − (𝜌𝐴�𝑘�𝑘�𝑎�𝑎�𝑀�𝑖𝑘�)2)

𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝐴�𝑘�𝑎�𝑘�𝑎�𝑦 = [(0.4 ∗ (−2,041))2 + (1 − (0.4)2) ∗ (−2,041)2]
12.53. The calculation above shows that, when there is only one commodity type within
a hedging set, the hedging-set add-on is equal (in absolute value) to the 
commodity-type add-on.
12.54. Similarly, “Silver” is the only commodity type in the “Metals” hedging set, and
so the add-on for the metals hedging set is:
𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝑀𝑎�𝑘�𝑎𝑘�𝑘� = |𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝑅�𝑖𝑘�𝑘�𝑎�𝑘�| = 1,800
12.55. Step 6: Calculate the asset class level add-on (𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝐴�𝑘�𝑘�𝑘�𝑘�𝑎�𝑖𝑘�𝑦) by adding
together all of the hedging set level add-ons calculated in step 5:

𝐻𝑅�
12.56. For this netting set the commodity add-on (𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝐴�𝑘�𝑘�𝑘�𝑘�𝑎�𝑖𝑘�𝑦) is also the aggregate
add-on (𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝑎𝑎�𝑎�𝑘�𝑎�𝑎�𝑎𝑘�𝑎�) because there are no derivatives belonging to other asset 
classes.
12.57. Finally, aggregating the replacement cost and the PFE component and
multiplying the result by the alpha factor of 1.4, the EAD is as follows (USD 
thousands):
𝐴�𝐴𝐴� = 1.4 ∗ (20 + 1 ∗ 3,841) = 5,406
Example 4: Interest rate and credit derivatives (unmargined netting set)
12.58.  Netting set 4 consists of the combined trades of Examples 1 and 2. There is no
margin agreement and no collateral. The replacement cost of the combined 
netting set is:
𝑅𝐴� = 𝑘�𝑎𝑥{𝑉 − 𝐴�; 0} = 𝑘�𝑎𝑥{30 − 20 + 50 + 20 − 40 + 0; 0} = 40
12.59. The aggregate add-on for the combined netting set is the sum of add-ons for each
asset class. In this case, there are two asset classes, interest rates and credit, and 
the add-ons for these asset classes have been copied from Examples 1 and 2:
𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝑎𝑎�𝑎�𝑘�𝑎�𝑎�𝑎𝑘�𝑎� = 𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝐻�𝑅 + 𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝐴�𝑘�𝑎�𝑎�𝑖𝑘� = 347 + 282 = 629
12.60. Because V-C is positive, the multiplier is equal to 1. Finally, the EAD can be
calculated as:
𝐴�𝐴𝐴� = 1.4 ∗ (40 + 1 ∗ 629) = 936
Example 5: Interest rate and commodities derivatives (unmargined netting set)
12.61. Netting set 5 consists of the combined trades of Examples 1 and 3. However,
instead of being unmargined (as assumed in those examples), the trades are 
subject to a margin agreement with the following specifications:

12.62. The above table depicts a situation in which the bank received from the
counterparty a net independent amount of 150 (taking into account the net amount 
of initial margin posted by the counterparty and any unsegregated initial margin 
posted by the bank). The total net collateral (after the application of haircuts) 
currently held by the bank is 200, which includes 50 for variation margin (VM) 
received and 150 for the net independent amount.
12.63. First, we determine the replacement cost. The net collateral currently held is 200
and the net independent collateral amount (NICA) is equal to the independent 
amount (that is, 150). The current market value of the trades in the netting set (V) 
is 80, it is calculated as the sum of the market value of the trades, i.e. 30 – 20 + 
50 – 50 – 30 + 100 = 80. The replacement cost for margined netting sets is 
calculated using the formula set out in 6.20. Using this formula the replacement 
cost for the netting set in this example is:
𝑅𝐴� = 𝑘�𝑎𝑥{𝑉 − 𝐴�; 𝑅�𝐻 + 𝑀𝑅�𝐴 − 𝑀�𝐻�𝐴�𝐴; 0} = 𝑘�𝑎𝑥{80 − 200; 0 + 5 − 150; 0} = 0
12.64. Second, it is necessary to recalculate the interest rate and commodity add-ons,
based on the value of the maturity factor for margined transactions, which 
depends on the margin period of risk. For daily re-margining, the margin period 
of risk (MPOR) would be 10 days. In accordance with 6.53, for netting sets that 
are not subject daily margin agreements the MPOR is the sum of nine business 
days plus the re-margining period (which is five business days in this example). 
Thus the MPOR is 14 (= 9 + 5) in this example.
12.65. The re-scaled maturity factor for the trades in the netting set is calculated using
the formula set out in 6.55. Using the MPOR calculated above, the maturity factor 
for all trades in the netting set in this example it is calculated as follows (a market 
convention of 250 business days in the financial year is used):

12.66. For the interest rate add-on, the effective notional for each trade (𝐴�𝑖 = 𝑐�𝑖 ∗ 𝑀𝐴�𝑖 ∗

12.67. Next, the effective notional of each of the three maturity buckets within each
hedging set must now be calculated. However, as set out in 12.16, given that in 
this example there are no maturity buckets within a hedging set with more than a 
single trade, the effective maturity of each maturity bucket is simply equal to the 
effective notional of the single trade in each bucket. Specifically:
(1) For the USD hedging set: 𝐴�𝐴�1 is zero, 𝐴�𝐴�2 is -12,869 (thousand USD) and
DB3 is 27,934 (thousand USD).
(2) For the EUR hedging set: 𝐴�𝐴�1 and 𝐴�𝐴�2are zero and 𝐴�𝐴�3is -3,579 (thousand
USD).
12.68. Next, the effective notional of each of the two hedging sets (USD and EUR) must
be recalculated using formula set out in 12.18 and the updated values of the 
effective notionals of each maturity bucket. The calculation is as follows:
1
2 = 21,934
𝐴�𝑀�𝑅�𝑅�𝐴� = [(−12,869)2 + (27,934)2 + 1.4 ∗ (−12,869) ∗ 27,934]

𝐴�𝑀�𝐴�𝑅�𝑅 = [(−3,579)2]
12.69. Next, the hedging set level add-ons (𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�ℎ𝑘�) must be recalculated by
multiplying the recalculated effective notionals of each hedging set (𝐴�𝑀�ℎ𝑘�) by the 
prescribed supervisory factor of the hedging set (𝑅�𝐴�𝑅�𝑅�𝐴�). As set out in 12.16, the

prescribed supervisory factor in this case is 0.5%. Therefore, the add-on for the 
USD and EUR hedging sets are, respectively (expressed in USD thousands):
𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝑅�𝑅�𝐴� = 21,039 ∗ 0.005 = 105
𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝐴�𝑅�𝑅 = 3,579 ∗ 0.005 = 18
12.70. Finally, the interest rate asset class level add-on (𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝐻�𝑅) can be recalculated
by adding together the USD and EUR hedging set level add-ons as follows 
(expressed in USD thousands):
𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝐻�𝑅 = 105 + 18 = 123
12.71. The add-on for the commodity asset class must also be recalculated using the
maturity factor for the margined netting. The effective notional for each trade

12.72. The combined effective notional for all derivatives with each hedging set that
reference the same commodity type (𝐴�𝑀�𝐴�𝑘�𝑘�𝑅�𝑦𝑘�𝑎�) must be recalculated by adding 
together the trade-level effective notionals above for each commodity type. This 
gives the following:
(1) 𝐴�𝑀�𝐴�𝑘�𝑘�𝑎�𝑎�𝑀�𝑖𝑘� = 3,550 + (−7,100) = 3,550
(2) 𝐴�𝑀�𝑅�𝑖𝑘�𝑘�𝑎�𝑘� = 3,550

each hedging set calculated in 12.50 must now be recalculated by multiplying the

recalculated combined effective notional for that commodity by the relevant 
supervisory factor (i.e. 18%). Therefore:
(1) 𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝐴�𝑘�𝑘�𝑎�𝑎�𝑀�𝑖𝑘� = −3,550 ∗ 0.18 = −639
(2) 𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝑅�𝑖𝑘�𝑘�𝑎�𝑘� = 3,550 ∗ 0.18 = −639
12.74. Next, recalculate the add-on for energy and metals hedging sets using the
recalculated add-ons for each commodity type above. As noted in 12.53, given 
that there is only one commodity type with each hedging set, the hedging set level 
add on is simply equal to the absolute value of the commodity type add-on. That 
is:
𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝐴�𝑘�𝑎�𝑘�𝑎�𝑦 = |𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝐴�𝑘�𝑘�𝑎�𝑎�𝑀�𝑖𝑘�| = 639
𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝑀𝑎�𝑘�𝑎𝑘� = |𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝑅�𝑖𝑘�𝑘�𝑎�𝑘�| = 639
12.75. Finally, calculate the commodity asset class level add-on (𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝐴�𝑘�𝑘�𝑘�𝑘�𝑎�𝑖𝑘�𝑦) by
adding together the hedging set level add-ons:
𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝐴�𝑘�𝑘�𝑘�𝑘�𝑎�𝑖𝑘�𝑦 = ∑ 𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝐻𝑅� = 639 + 639 = 1,278
𝐻𝑅�
12.76. The aggregate netting set level add-on can now be calculated. As set out in 6.27,
it is calculated as the sum of the asset class level add-ons. That is for this example:
𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝑎𝑎�𝑎�𝑘�𝑎�𝑎�𝑎𝑘�𝑎�
=
∑
𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�(𝑎𝑘�𝑘�𝑎�𝑘�𝑎�𝑘�𝑎𝑘�𝑘�) = 𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝐻�𝑅 + 𝐴𝑐�𝑐�𝑀�𝑘�𝐴�𝑘�𝑘�𝑘�𝑘�𝑎�𝑖𝑘�𝑦
𝑎𝑘�𝑘�𝑎�𝑘�𝑎�𝑘�𝑎𝑘�𝑘�
= 123 + 1,278 = 1,401
12.77. As can be seen from 12.63, the value of V-C is negative (i.e. -120) and so the
multiplier will be less than 1. The multiplier is calculated using the formula set 
out in 6.25, which for this example gives:
𝑘�𝑟�𝑘�𝑟�𝑖𝑘�𝑘�𝑖𝑐�𝑟 = 𝑘�𝑖𝑘� (1; 0.05 + 0.95 ∗ 𝑐�𝑥𝑘� (
80 − 200
2 ∗ 0.95 ∗ 1,401)) = 0.958
12.78. Finally, aggregating the replacement cost and the PFE component and
multiplying the result by the alpha factor of 1.4, the EAD is as follows (USD 
thousands):

13. The effect of standard margin agreements on the calculation of
replacement cost with SA-CCR
13.1. In this section (13.1 to 13.18), five examples are used to illustrate the operation
of the SA-CCR in the context of standard margin agreements. In particular, they 
relate to the formulation of replacement cost for margined trades, as set out in 
6.20:
𝑅𝐴� = 𝑘�𝑎𝑥{𝑉 − 𝐴�; 𝑅�𝐻 + 𝑀𝑅�𝐴 − 𝑀�𝐻�𝐴�𝐴; 0}
Example 1
13.2. The bank currently has met all past VM calls so that the value of trades with its
counterparty (€80 million) is offset by cumulative VM in the form of cash 
collateral received. There is a small “Minimum Transfer Amount” (MTA) of €1 
million and a €0 ”Threshold” (TH). Furthermore, an “Independent Amount” (IA) 
of €10 million is agreed in favor of the bank and none in favor of its counterparty 
(i.e. the NICA is €10 million. This leads to a credit support amount of €90 million, 
which is assumed to have been fully received as of the reporting date.
13.3. In this example, the three terms in the replacement cost formula are:
(1) V - C =€80 million – €90 million = negative €10 million.
(2) TH + MTA – NICA = €0 + €1 million - €10 million = negative €9 million.
(3) The third term in the RC formula is always zero, which ensures that
replacement cost is not negative.
13.4. The highest of the three terms (-€10 million, -€9 million, 0) is zero, so the
replacement cost is zero. This is due to the large amount of collateral posted by 
the bank’s counterparty.
Example 2
13.5. The counterparty has met all VM calls but the bank has some residual exposure
due to the MTA of €1 million in its master agreement, and has a €0 TH. The value 
of the bank’s trades with the counterparty is €80 million and the bank holds €79.5 
million in VM in the form of cash collateral. In addition, the bank holds €10

million in independent collateral (here being an initial margin independent of 
VM, the latter of which is driven by mark-to-market (MTM) changes) from the 
counterparty. The counterparty holds €10 million in independent collateral from 
the bank, which is held by the counterparty in a non-segregated manner. The 
NICA is therefore €0 (= €10 million independent collateral held less €10 million 
independent collateral posted).
13.6. In this example, the three terms in the replacement formula are:
(1) V – C = €80 million – (€79.5 million + €10 million - €10 million)= €0.5
million.
(2) TH + MTA – NICA = €0 + €1 million – €0 = €1 million.
(3) The third term is zero.
13.7. The replacement cost is the highest of the three terms (€0.5 million, €1 million,
0) which is €1 million. This represents the largest exposure before collateral must 
be exchanged.
Bank as a clearing member
13.8. The case of central clearing can be viewed from a number of perspectives. One
example in which the replacement cost formula for margined trades can be 
applied is when the bank is a clearing member and is calculating replacement cost 
for its own trades with a central counterparty (CCP). In this case, the MTA and 
TH are generally zero. VM is usually exchanged at least daily and the independent 
collateral amount (ICA) in the form of a performance bond or IM is held by the 
CCP.
Example 3
13.9. The bank, in its capacity as clearing member of a CCP, has posted VM to the
CCP in an amount equal to the value of the trades it has with the CCP. The bank 
has posted cash as initial margin and the CCP holds the IM in a bankruptcy-
remote fashion. Assume that the value of trades with the CCP are negative €50 
million, the bank has posted €50 million in VM and €10 million in IM to the CCP.
13.10. Given that the IM is held by the CCP in a bankruptcy remote fashion, 6.19 permits
this amount to be excluded in the calculation NICA. Therefore, the NICA is €0

because the bankruptcy-remote IM posted to the CCP can be exclude and the 
bank has not received any IM from the CCP. The value of C is calculated as the 
value of NICA plus any VM received less any VM posted. The value of C is thus 
negative €50 million (= €0 million + €0 million - €50 million).
13.11. In this example, the three terms in the replacement formula are:
(1) V – C = (-€50 million) – (-€50 million) = €0. That is, the negative value of the
trades has been fully offset by the VM posted by the bank.
(2) TH + MTA – NICA = €0 + €0 - €0 = €0.
(3) The third term is zero.
13.12. The replacement cost is therefore €0.
Example 4
13.13. Example 4 is the same as Example 3, except that the IM posted to the CCP is not
bankruptcy-remote. As a consequence, the €10 million of IM must be included in 
the calculation of NICA. Thus, NICA is negative €10 million (= ICA received of 
€0 minus unsegregated ICA posted of €10 million). Also, the value of C is 
negative €60 million (=NICA + VM received - VM posted = -€10 million + €0 - 
€50 million).
13.14. In this example, the three terms in the replacement formula are:
(1) V – C = (-€50 million) – (-€60 million) = €10 million. That is, the negative
value of the trades is more than fully offset by collateral posted by the bank.
(2) TH + MTA – NICA = €0 + €0 – (-€10 million) = €10 million.
(3) The third term is zero.
13.15. The replacement cost is therefore €10 million. This represents the IM posted to
the CCP which risks being lost upon default and bankruptcy of the CCP.
Example 5: Maintenance Margin Agreement
13.16. Some margin agreements specify that a counterparty (in this case, a bank) must
maintain a level of collateral that is a fixed percentage of the MTM of the 
transactions in a netting set. For this type of margining agreement, ICA is the

amount of collateral that the counterparty must maintain above the net MTM of 
the transactions.
13.17. For example, suppose the agreement states that a counterparty must maintain a
collateral balance of at least 140% of the MTM of its transactions and that the 
MtM of the derivatives transactions is €50 in the bank’s favor. ICA in this case is 
€20 (= 140% * €50 – €50). Further, suppose there is no TH, no MTA, the bank 
has posted no collateral and the counterparty has posted €80 in cash collateral. In 
this example, the three terms of the replacement cost formula are:
(1) V – C = €50 - €80 = -€30.
(2) MTA + TH - NICA = €0 + €0 - €20 = -€20.
(3) The third term is zero.
13.18. Thus, the replacement cost is zero in this example.
