The Saudi Arabian Financial Entities Ethical Red Teaming Framework
1.1. Introduction  
It is crucial that the Member Organizations within the Financial Sector are resilient against the newest and 
most advanced cyber-attacks.
The Financial Entities Ethical Red Teaming Framework (F.E.E.R.) is intended as a guide for Member 
Organizations within Saudi Arabia in preparing and executing controlled attacks (i.e. threat intelligence 
based red teaming tests) against their (live) production environment without exposing sensitive 
information with the help of certified and experienced Red Teaming Providers. 
 
The Saudi Arabia Monetary Authority (SAMA) has a leading role in the implementation of this Framework. 
This Framework and associated processes will be continuously improved using the feedback and lessons 
learned from each red teaming exercise. This framework aims for sharing of intelligence and information 
obtained during such testing in order to further improve the cyber resilience of the Saudi Arabian Financial 
Sector.
Red Teaming should not be regarded as an Audit. It is a simulation test, which seeks to provide insight 
into the level of resilience and effectiveness of the implemented cyber security controls and relevant 
processes (i.e. detection and response).
Red Teaming is not a penetration test. In contrast to a penetration test (in which one or more specific 
information assets are tested and assessed), it focuses on replicating a targeted and realistic attack against 
the entire Member Organization performed in a controlled manner.
The Red Teaming Provider will use the latest attack tactics, techniques and procedures (i.e. TTPs) in an 
attempt to compromise the Member Organization, aiming to reach the member organizations most 
important and valuable information assets and to test the detection and response capabilities of the 
Member Organization. The Red Team consists of certified and experienced ethical hackers with in-depth 
knowledge of all security domains.
1.2. Objective of the Framework 
The principal objective of the framework is to provide guidance on how to conduct the red teaming 
activities and how to test the detection and response capabilities of the Member Organization against real 
sophisticated and advanced attacks and enhance the knowledge of the involved stakeholders. Likewise, 
the Framework aims to support the sharing of threat intelligence and lessons learned with the Member 
Organizations that will contribute to the cyber resilience of the Saudi Arabian Financial Sector.
The Framework will ensure that the red teaming exercise is executed in a controlled manner. This is 
important given the nature of the targets during the testing, namely business critical and (live) production 
systems (i.e. critical information assets).
1.3. Applicability 
The Framework applies to all Member Organizations in the Financial Sector, which are regulated by SAMA. 
SAMA has the authority to select any Member Organization and request the organization to perform a 
red teaming test considering the emerging threat landscape or based on the latest threat intelligence. In 
addition, member organization can rightfully conduct red teaming tests in order to ensure security 
resilience.

## Page 5

1.4. Responsibilities 
The framework is mandated by SAMA. SAMA is the owner and is responsible for periodically updating the 
Framework.
1.5. Interpretation 
SAMA, as the owner of the Framework, is solely responsible for providing advice on the interpretation of 
the principles, objectives and considerations, if required.
1.6. Periodicity of the Red Teaming tests 
Each Member Organization within the Financial Sector of Saudi Arabia and are regulated by SAMA should 
be tested, as a minimum once every three (3) years, in line with this framework.
1.7. Target Audience 
The Framework is intended for Senior and Executive Management, business owners, owners of 
information assets, CISOs and those who are responsible for (or involved in) defining, implementing and 
reviewing cyber security controls within the Financial Sector and tasked with the improvement of the 
cyber resilience of the Member Organization.
1.8. Review, Updates and Maintenance  
The framework will be maintained by SAMA and reviewed periodically to determine the framework’s 
effectiveness, including the extent to which it addresses emerging cybersecurity threats and risks. If 
applicable, SAMA will update the Framework based on the outcome of the review and lessons learned.
1.9. Additional Information  
For any further information or enquiries about the Saudi Arabian Financial Entities Ethical Red Teaming 
Framework, please contact IT Risk of Financial Sector Supervision Department.

Background
More and more governments, national agencies and regulators consider the protection of their national 
or sector-wide critical infrastructure as a high priority on their national cyber security agenda. In order to 
test the cyber resilience of the critical infrastructure, governments, agencies and regulators are 
increasingly embracing red teaming approaches. These red teaming approaches are generally 
underpinned by a framework which outlines how red teaming tests should be conducted, how to identify 
the organizations which should be considered part of the key or core infrastructure and the periodicity or 
frequency of these tests.
In a red teaming test, an organization performs a ‘simulation’ of a realistic cyber-attack. The Red Teaming 
Provider, consisting of certified and experienced ethical hackers, will execute / simulate cyber-attacks 
based on available threat intelligence and attack scenarios, which aims to test the cyber resilience of an 
organization.
The cyber security attacks are cautiously modelled and tested, and will simulate a malicious attacker - 
using their attack approach - from the reconnaissance activities up to the actual compromise of the critical 
information asset(s). The simulation of these (attack) steps are executed and tested during a red teaming 
test and will provide vital insights into the organization's resilience against cyber-attacks.
2.1 Stakeholders 
The stakeholders within the red teaming exercises have different roles and corresponding responsibilities. 
Irrespective of role, it is important that everyone is aware that any form of testing is performed in a 
controlled manner, and that a communication protocol is agreed regarding the sharing of information 
among the stakeholders. The relevant stakeholders are:
1. SAMA IT Risk of Financial Sector Supervision department – The authority that has primary
responsibility for overseeing the Red Teaming exercise.
2. The Member Organization – Each Financial Organization within the Financial Sector of Saudi Arabia
and regulated by SAMA.
3. The Security Operations Centre – The SOC positioned within the Member Organization, which will be
subject to the red teaming test.
4. The Red Teaming Provider – An external certified party, which has been selected to perform the red
teaming exercise and provide required national or sector threat intelligence to define scenarios.
5. Available Member Organization committees (e.g. Banking Committee for Information Security - BCIS)
– Relevant results of executed red teaming tests, lessons learned and threat Intelligence might be 
shared within this committee, in an appropriately sanitized form using the agreed communication 
protocol, to support the increase of the overall cyber resilience of the (financial) sector.

## Page 7

2.2 Required Teams 
For the execution of the red teaming exercise, the following teams should be established:
Green Team 
SAMA IT Risk of Financial Sector Supervision department provides the Green Team. The Green Team 
appoints the Test Manager for each red teaming test. The Test Manager is responsible for guiding and 
supporting the White Team through the red teaming exercise. The Green Team approves the selection of 
Red Teaming Provider and provides – when applicable – additional or specific threat intelligence for the 
Financial Sector.
White Team 
Within the Member Organization, the White Team should be appointed (including a White Team Leader), 
who will be responsible for the controlled execution of the red teaming exercise. The White Team consist 
of a limited number of security and business experts which are the only staff members that are aware of 
the red teaming test and who are the single-point-of-contacts (SPOCs), e.g. CISO. They will monitor the 
test and intervene when needed, e.g. when the test or results of the test are likely to, or have, caused a 
critical impact, compromise or service disruption.
The overall number of staff members that should be involved in the engagement, should be limited to 
maximum five (5) people, to avoid a too wide disclosure of the intended cyber-attack simulation and – as 
a result – that the effectiveness of the exercise is limited or flawed.
Blue Team 
The cyber security monitoring team of the Member Organization (e.g. SOC) which monitors and analyses 
the generated security alerts and events to identify security breaches or flaws. It is the task of the Blue 
Team to detect the malicious activities (of the Red Team) and to follow the agreed incident response 
procedures the moment an incident is detected. The Blue Team should never be informed about the test 
and are expected to follow their standard operating procedures, in order to simulate a realistic attack.
Red Team 
The Red Team, a selected third party that executes the attack scenarios and consists of certified and 
experienced specialists. The Red Team will work with the Green Team and White Team to develop the 
potential threats and attack scenarios. The Red Teaming Provider is also responsible for providing the 
latest threat intelligence related to the Financial Sector in order to achieve a certain level of assurance 
that the Member Organization is tested against the latest known (sophisticated) cyber-attacks.
Please refer to Appendix A – Requirements for Red Teaming Provider, for more details on Red Teaming 
Provider requirements.
2.3 Penetration Testing versus Red Teaming  
There is a significant difference between red teaming exercise and penetration testing. Red teaming 
focusses on testing the cyber resilience of an organization. In a penetration test, the scope is often limited 
to an application or system, with the intent to comprehensively test the security of that limited scope 
application or system.
The overall objective of a red teaming exercise is different from the objective of a penetration test. In a 
red teaming exercise, the objective is to (independently) test the overall cyber resilience of a Member
<image: DeviceRGB, width: 1556, height: 50, bpc: 8>

## Page 8

Organization. This is achieved by testing the implemented cyber security controls, along with the 
detection and response capabilities.
A secondary objective is to share the lessons learned with the Member Organizations within the Financial 
Sector, to further improve the overall cyber resilience within the sector.

2.4 The Cyber Kill Chain Methodology 
The Cyber Kill Chain1 provides a conceptual model to describe an attack. The term “chain” reflects the 
end-to-end process adopted by an attacker.
The Cyber Kill Chain provides a good insight into how an attack works and where the different tools and 
methods employed at each stage. To lower the risk of a successful attack, defensive measures (e.g. 
preventive, detective and responsive and corrective) should be considered and taken for each of the steps 
of the kill chain to reduce the probability of being compromised and improve the resilience of the Member 
Organization.
The following seven (7) stages characterize an advanced cyber-attack in the cyber kill chain:
Reconnaissance
Weaponization
Delivery
Exploitation
Installation

Figure 2 Seven stages of a cyber-attack, with the red team and blue teams main tasks
1. Reconnaissance:
The first stage is about selecting a target and gathering information about the target to determine attack 
methods. This happens before the attack is executed. Examples of useful information can be: names,

framework to defend computer networks in 2011.

## Page 9

phone numbers, email addresses, functions, private or professional areas of interest of employees on the 
internet and published information about the software that an organization is using.
2. Weaponize:
The attacker creates the malicious payload/file for a specific target based upon information retrieved 
during the reconnaissance stage. The attack can come in many different formats and is based upon the 
creativity of the attacker, the available set of defenses and the possible vulnerabilities.
3. Delivery:
The transmission of the crafted attack to the victims by the use of different means, such as: email 
(attachments), phishing, websites, physical devices or social engineering.
4. Exploitation:
Triggering or activating the malicious payload/file (i.e. malware) will result in a successful penetration of 
the target’s system and network. A staged malware attack limits the possibility of detection. The malware 
will communicate back to the malicious attacker over a secure channel, which limits the chance of 
detection. Attackers usually use popular methods and file formats to deliver the malware executables 
(e.g. Microsoft office files, pdf files, malicious websites, phishing emails and removable media).
5. Installation:
The actual installation of malicious payload/file or software that supports the malicious attacker. In order 
to make the malware and backdoor(s) persistent, the attackers could install additional malware or 
malicious software tools to ensure that the attack can continue if the initial compromised system or active 
malware is disabled.
6. Command and Control:
A compromised system will usually connect back to the attacker, to establish a so-called command-and-
control channel, which allows remote control of the malware. Especially in advanced persistent threat 
(APT) malware, the attacker will control the malware and explore the network by using this type of remote 
access.
7. Actions on Objective:
After the attacker completed his malicious actions or achieved his goals, the attacker will try to cover his 
digital tracks and traces by using different techniques, like data exfiltration, or will use the compromised 
system as starting point to ‘hop on’ to other systems in the network (i.e. lateral movement), to search for 
other high value assets or targets.
2.5 Threat intelligence 
The Red Teaming Provider(s) will maintain and deliver the threat intelligence landscape relevant for Saudi 
Arabian Financial Sector or specific Member Organization. This can be enriched using the provided input 
from SAMA (i.e. the IT Risk of Financial Sector Supervision department, or the Green Team), the White 
Team and, various governmental agencies. The Red Teaming Providers should provide the latest threat 
intelligence related to the Financial Sector in order to achieve a certain level of assurance that the Member 
Organization is tested against the latest known (sophisticated) cyber-attacks.

2.6 Overview of the Phases 
The Saudi Arabian Financial Entities Ethical Red Teaming Framework consists of four phases. In the 
corresponding chapters of this framework, each phase is described in detail.
<image: DeviceRGB, width: 1041, height: 159, bpc: 8>
Please refer to Appendix C – Glossary for more details and definitions regarding this Framework.
3 
Preparation phase
3.1 Overview 
The Green Team initiates the preparation phase of the red teaming exercise by appointing a Test Manager. 
A Backup Test Manager should also be nominated given the importance of this role.
The Test Manager is responsible for contacting the Member Organization to explain the red teaming 
concept and processes. The Test Manager will invite the Member Organization to appoint and formalize 
their White Team and start contracting the Red Teaming Provider.
The White Team Leader initiates a kick-off session, where all relevant stakeholders (i.e. Green, White and 
Red Team) are invited to align the ambition and objectives of the red teaming exercise.
4 weeks
3.2 Green Team: Determining Test Manager 
The Test Manager is a crucial person during the Red Teaming exercise. This person should have extensive 
experience in project management and in-depth understanding of the banking and cyber security sector.
The Test Manager of the Green Team should invite the Member Organization to appoint a White Team. 
During the entire red teaming exercise, the White Team will keep close contact with the Test Manager.
The Test Manager will oversee the Red Teaming exercise and will provide support, guidance and 
reflections to ensure that the entire Red Teaming exercise performed by the White Team and Red Teaming 
Provider is in line with the Framework. As the Test Manager is not a formal part of the White Team, he 
cannot be held accountable for any actions or consequences.
3.3 Selecting a Red Teaming Provider 
The Green Team will appoint the red team provider, who are pre-selected to execute the Red Teaming 
tests, based on their experiences and skilled staff. Given the fact, that these ethical hacking tests are 
carried out on the live production systems, it is crucial that the Red Teaming Provider has a proven track 
record and has the required skills, expertise, certifications and experienced staff to perform the red 
teaming test.
Please refer to Appendix A – Requirements for Red Teaming Provider, for more details on Red Teaming 
Provider requirements.
<image: DeviceRGB, width: 1556, height: 50, bpc: 8>
10

## Page 11

3.4 Determining White Team 
The Member Organization should carefully establish a White Team and nominate a White Team Leader in 
order to facilitate, oversee and lead the red teaming exercises during all phases. The White Team Leader’s 
role is to make sure that the entire Red Teaming exercise is performed in a controlled manner, on behalf 
of the Member Organization. After establishing the White Team, the White Team Leader needs to 
coordinate with the appointed Red Teaming Provider for contract and invite the Red Teaming Provider to 
the kick-off meeting.
3.5 Procuring a Red Teaming Provider 
Upon approval of the Red Teaming Provider by the Green Team, the Member Organization should initiate 
their procurement process. During the procurement of the Red Teaming Provider, the Member 
Organization should undertake the following activities:
 
Agreeing on contractual considerations, e.g. Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) clauses, the liability 
for any consequence flowing from the test, and a Letter of Authorization (LOA);
 
Introduce the Red Team members to the White and Green Team.
Please refer to Appendix A – Requirements for Red Teaming Provider, for more details on Red Teaming 
Provider requirements.
After the procurement of the Red Teaming Provider, the White Team should start involving the Red 
Teaming Provider and its identified staff, to ensure their experience and input is fully utilized and that the 
staff of the Red Teaming Provider is introduced into the business model and services of the Member 
Organization.
3.6 Defining the Scope 
During a kick-off session with all relevant stakeholders (Green, White and Red Team), the scope and the 
target critical information assets (i.e. ‘red flags’) should be defined for the attack scenarios. Moreover, the 
planning of the project is discussed in detail along with the responsibilities for each team. Deliverables 
and contractual considerations should be discussed during the session. The White Team should determine 
the flags that should be targeted or attacked.
The Red Teaming Provider will share their advice and recommendations to the White and Green Team 
based on their (previous) experience in order to support the scoping discussion.
Boundaries, limitations and escalation procedure for the red teaming test should be discussed and defined 
by the White Team with mutual understanding with the Green Team. Another important step is to agree 
on the liability for the actions of the Red Teaming Provider (see also 3.5).
The White Team should create a Scoping document. This document should contain contact details of the 
White Team members and the identified flags (i.e. defined goals or target systems) during the red teaming 
exercise. This document also contains the overall plan for the exercise, predefined escalation procedures 
and communication protocols (including the code-name for the test).
Once the scope is defined by the White Team, the Scoping document should be submitted to the Green 
Team for approval.

Scenario phase
4.1 
Overview
At the beginning of this phase, the Green and White Team should independently provide their available 
Threat Intelligence (TI) to the Red Team. The Red Teaming provider will combine the received Threat 
Intelligence, with their own Threat Intelligence (which should be based on their own sources, their 
experience and earlier executed tests). Based on the combined threat intelligence the Red Team 
determines the attack scenarios and strategies. These attack scenarios and strategies are than discussed 
with the Green Team before defining the detailed attack Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs). If 
necessary, a discussion with Red and White Team should be initiated to further discuss and agree on the 
final attack scenarios in the light of Green Team comments. 
 
The scenario phase usually takes several weeks (maximal five (5) weeks). An overview of the process is 
depicted below:

4.2 Threat Intelligence Gathering 
Each of the teams provides their collated threat Intelligence independently. The Green Team will provide 
(when available) their sector-wide threat intelligence which is known and available via the Member 
Organizations or incidents. This may include threat intelligence from governmental agencies, which could 
be relevant to the Member Organization. The White Team should provide the Member Organization’s 
input including specific threat intelligence considered relevant for their business and linked to the internal 
or external trends or incidents, they identified.

The Red Teaming Provider will combine the received threat intelligence with their external threat 
intelligence (including and using their own ‘open’ sources), and the intelligence gathered during various 
red teaming engagements. 
 
4.3 Defining and Approval of high-level attack scenarios 
Based on all received threat intelligence, the Red Team should analyze, outline and create realistic attack 
scenarios and prepare a test strategy document. Once the scenarios are determined, the attack scenarios 
and test strategy should be agreed upon before the Red Teaming Provider starts with the creation of the 
specific attack scenarios.
4.4 Preparing and Approval of detailed attack scenarios 
The detailed attack scenarios should be mapped to one or more critical information assets combining the 
external, internal (i.e. Member Organization specific) and sector-wide threat intelligence. Each attack 
scenario should include a written description of the kill chain from the attacker’s point of view. The Red 
Teaming Provider should indicate various attack options, based on various tactics, techniques and 
procedures (TTPs) used by experienced testers and attackers. As with the high-level attack scenarios and 
test strategy, the detailed scenarios have to be agreed with the Green Team.
4.5 Finalizing the Red Teaming Plan 
The final red teaming plan should not only consist of the different attack scenarios that the Red Teaming 
Provider will perform, but also define the agreed escalation procedures and communication protocols. 
Given the fact that critical production systems are in scope for the red teaming test, the Red Teaming 
Provider should be aware and consider how to react in case of any unexpected issues or disruptions. After 
finalizing the red teaming plan, final approval by the White and Green Team is required before Red 
Teaming Provider can proceed with executing the attack scenarios.

Execution phase
5.1 Overview 
The phase starts with the Red Teaming Provider executing the attack scenarios. During the process, the 
White and Green Team should be updated regularly. All actions should be logged for evidence and replay 
purposes, with the Blue Team.
An overview of the process is depicted below:

5.2 Execute Red Teaming plan 
The Red Teaming Provider should start the execution of the red teaming exercise following the agreed 
scenarios and against the identified critical (information) assets or functions. It should be noted that the 
agreed scenarios do not have to be followed precisely as these are outline and may not reflect the precise 
operational environment encountered during the execution phase. Nevertheless, the Red Teaming 
Provider should inform the White Team Leader and Green Team about the suggested adjustments in the 
scenarios. Deviation from the initial scenarios should be allowed and is desirable if obstacles are 
encountered.
Red Teaming Provider should apply their expertise and ‘creativity’ to develop alternative ways or 
workarounds in order to reach the identified critical (information) assets or functions. It is crucial that the 
Red Teaming Provider remains in close contact with both the Green and the White Team and does provide 
periodic updates on the progress made during the red teaming test - in line with the frequency which was 
agreed during the kick-off, or in case of escalations or severe incidents or occurrences - immediately.

## Page 15

5.3 Executing the Defined and Agreed Scenarios 
If the Blue Team detects any events triggered by the Red Team while performing their actions, the Red 
Teaming Provider should decide in conjunction with the White Team Leader if the red teaming test can 
be continued in line with the initial plan or whether the initial attack plan can be adjusted.
The White Team Leader should consider the following options when the actions of the Red Teaming 
Provider are detected:
1. Stop or postpone the test in case there is a significant risk of a business disruption; 
2. Carefully monitor and direct the Blue Team or response activities, in case extreme actions are about
to be taken (i.e. reporting the incident to law enforcement, shutting down critical services to avoid to 
avoid further impact from the incident, ..Etc.);
3. Inform the Red Teaming Provider to continue with the initial attack scenarios; 
4. Inform the Red Teaming Provider to revise the (detected) attack or to create a workaround for the
specific critical information asset and continue with the revised attack scenario after approval from 
the White Team Leader;
5. Inform Green Team on the detection of events and decision on the exercise.  
6. Request the Red Teaming Provider to re-engineer an alternate attack scenario for an adjusted critical
information assets (e.g. change in scope).
5.4 Reporting 
After completing the red teaming test, or stopping upon request of the White Team Leader, the Red 
Teaming Provider should prepare their initial observations and findings, preferably in chronological order. 
These observations and results should be discussed with the Green and White Team. These observations 
and findings provide the basis of evaluating the detection and response capabilities of the Blue Team. 
After the preliminary evaluation, the White Team should share their observations, from their respective 
role and point of view.
Note. After completing the red teaming test the Red Teaming Provider is required to immediately inform 
the White Team Leader of the installed red teaming scripts, code or malware, etc., including an overview 
the user-ids which were created, compromised or (re)used during the test. The White Team Leader needs 
to evidence to the Green Team that these ‘indicators of compromise' were removed or reset.
The White Team should include insights of what has and has not been detected or observed by the Blue 
Team. The Red Teaming Provider should use this information to overall assess and evaluate the Blue 
Team’s detection and response capabilities in the draft report. The Red Teaming Provider should include 
all relevant observations, findings, recommendations and evaluations, which were noted or experienced 
during preparation, scenario and execution phase, including those from the White and Green Team. The 
provided recommendation should consider SAMA Cyber Security Framework and other applicable 
industry good practice.
The final report should include the exploited cyber kill chains, summarized in the form of attack vector 
diagrams. These attack vector diagrams should provide insights into how the attack scenarios were 
executed and where to focus on when implementing mitigating controls. The final report should be agreed 
upon by all Teams involved and copy of the report should be submitted to SAMA by the provider.
Please refer to Appendix B – Requirements for Reporting, for more details on Red Teaming Provider 
requirements.

Lessons Learned phase
6.1 Overview 
In this phase, the Red Teaming Provider should deliver the final red teaming report, which should contain 
the overall assessment of the Member Organization’s resilience against targeted cyber-attacks.
The Blue Team should deliver the blue team report with their observations, findings and 
recommendations and should focus on the alerts and actions taken as part of the detection and response 
capabilities of the Member Organization.
Once the final red and blue team reports are distributed to all Teams. The White Team should invite the 
Red, Blue and Green Teams to participate in a (360 degrees) feedback session in which they share their 
observations and experiences for learning purposes (of the staff and management involved), to 
understand what capabilities need to be improved (e.g. prevent, detect and respond) and (enhancing) 
future exercises.
After the feedback session, a Replay Exercise should be organized, led by the Blue and Red Team. The 
objective of the joint Replay Exercise is to step through the red team exercise, discussing all the relevant 
actions and observations, highlighted from both angles, i.e. the Blue and Red Team.
The next step is the overall evaluation of the red teaming exercise processes itself. The outcome of the 
evaluation may contribute to vital information to enhance the Financial Entities Ethical Red Teaming 
Framework for future exercises.
The White Team should create a remediation plan based on the detailed observations and 
recommendations.
To ensure that all Member Organizations within the Financial Sector benefit from these red teaming 
exercises, an anonymized summary report of the executed red teaming test should be provided, and if 
required presented. The sharing of this report should be limited to the agreed with the closed community 
(i.e. addresses) and within the boundaries of the agreed communication protocol.
The duration of this phase is approximately four (4) weeks.
Based on the evaluations, feedback and sharing sessions SAMA should review, discuss and initiate 
adjustments to improve the current Framework, if required.

360 feedback session
6.2 Debriefing 
The Red Teaming Provider finalizes the red teaming report and presents the output to all the White and 
Blue Team. Simultaneously, the Blue Team should create a blue team report. The blue team report should 
provide the observations from the perspective of the Blue Team and should include the alert and events 
detected; the actions initiated and the result of these actions. The blue team reports should also provide 
the Blue Team’s recommendations for improvements.
It is important that all teams (i.e. Green, White and Red) that were directly involved in the red teaming 
test provide their (360 degrees) feedback on the executed red teaming test. The White Team should 
initiate and schedule a joint replay session with all the teams.
6.3 Red and Blue Team Replay Exercise 
After delivering the red and blue team reports, the White Team should organize a Replay Exercise. During 
this Replay Exercise, the Blue and Red Team jointly perform a chronological walkthrough of the red 
teaming exercise and the relevant alerts, events and attack steps that were initiated.
The purpose of the Replay Exercise is to explain and discuss each step and action individually to assess 
whether the alert or detected event lead to the expected actions. It is important to determine whether 
the initiated actions led to the expected results and whether the actions were correctly initiated or should 
be subject for improvement.
<image: DeviceRGB, width: 1556, height: 50, bpc: 8>
17

## Page 18

Replaying the red teaming exercise should ensure the more comprehensive (in-depth) understanding of 
the performed attack patterns, the current maturity of the detection and response capabilities and the 
implemented layered defenses or controls within the tested Member Organization.
Additionally, the White Team may repeat the replay exercise for specific target audiences within the 
Member Organization. It is strongly suggested to re-perform the replay exercise for:
a. The relevant staff members within the IT organization – the scope of this session can be a very in-
depth and technical session in order to provide the relevant insights in the technical and procedural 
aspects.
Note. When the level of detail is insufficient or the attack steps cannot be demonstrated, then 
there can be a tendency for members within the IT organization to downplay these attacks or 
argue that the exercise is just theoritical.
b. The Senior Management – a high-level replay session with the Senior Management should also seek
to raise awareness and educate Senior Management. The replay session should provide an overview 
and objective of the red teaming exercise, an overview of the performed attacks and responses, an 
overview of the current detection capabilities and an overview of the suggested improvements 
required to further improve the cyber resilience.
6.4 Defining the Remediation Plan 
The White Team should create a remediation plan based on the recommendations provided by the Red 
Team and Blue Team. The White Team should: 
 
analyze the observations and recommendations;
 
determine the improvements regarding the detection and response capabilities;
 
determine the associated risks and priorities.
The White Team shares the internally agreed and approved remediation plan with the Green Team and 
periodically track the remediation progress to ensure that the vulnerabilities identified are monitored and 
mitigated.
Note: The Green Team should not actively share nor distribute the red and blue team reports, nor the 
evaluation reports, nor the remediation plan unless the Member Organization provides written 
permission.  
 
As stated earlier, the primary objective of this Framework is exercising, learning and sharing.
6.5 Remediate Identified Vulnerabilities  
Shortly after finishing the red teaming exercise, the Member Organization, i.e. the White Team should 
start executing the agreed remediation activities and address the identified vulnerabilities.
The Member Organization should be tracking the actual remediation progress to ensure the timely 
execution and delivery of the improved capabilities. The Member Organization should ensure that the 
Cyber Security Committee (and if required the Senior Management) is periodically updated on the
<image: DeviceRGB, width: 1556, height: 50, bpc: 8>
18

## Page 19

progress of the planned remediation actions, and should request support when remediation activities do 
not progress as expected.
6.6 Sharing of the Lesson Learned 
An important activity within the lesson-learned phase is to provide an anonymized summary report of the 
executed red teaming test, which might be shared with Members Organizations Committees like e.g. BCIS.
Sharing the summarized report and the lessons learned helps other Member Organizations build the 
knowledge and experience they need to improve their own cyber resilience.
Note. The sharing of the report and lessons learned should be limited to the agreed with the closed 
community (i.e. addresses) and within the boundaries of the agreed communication protocol.
By applying the lessons learned within their own Member Organizations the cyber resilience of the overall 
Saudi Arabian Financial Sector will improve, regardless of whether the Member Organizations are 
considered systematic for the sector, or not.
6.7 Enhancing the Red Teaming Framework 
Based on the evaluations, feedback and lessons learned sharing sessions SAMA should review, discuss and 
initiate adjustments to improve the current Framework for future red teaming exercises.

Blue Team Report (BTR)  
After the distribution of the Red Team Evaluation Report, the Blue Team will generate their own report. 
This report should be based on the monitoring and detection alerts, response and recover activities and 
process-steps taken by the Blue Team during the exercise. The report should include the defense and 
monitoring techniques and capabilities that the Blue Team is currently using to detect cyber security 
attacks (e.g. events, alerts, incidents). The report should also include the Blue Team’s observations 
regarding the identified limitations or weaknesses.

Remediation Plan (RP)  
The White Team should draft a Remediation Plan, which should be based on the Red Teaming Evaluation 
Report and the Blue Team Report. The remediation plan should provide clear areas of improvements, 
priorities and a roadmap how and when to improve the prevention (e.g. hardening), detection, response 
and recover capabilities within the Member Organization. Important is that the status and progress of the 
remediation plan is monitored and periodically reported to the Cyber Security Committee of the Member 
Organization as well as the Green Team.

Red Teaming Test Summary Report (RTTSR)  
When the Remediation Plan is finalized, the White team will generate a summary test report (fully 
anonymized) in order to share via SAMA (i.e. the Green Team Test Manager) to all relevant Member 
Organization Committees (e.g. the BCIS). The summary test report should cover the current threat 
landscape for the financial sector, the red teaming test results and the observed weaknesses or 
vulnerabilities during the red teaming test and should include the lessons learned.
This report should only be provided via a secure communication channels and shared under an agreed 
communication protocol (i.e. need-to-have and for-you-eyes-only).

Security testing in which evaluators mimic real-world attacks in an attempt to identify 
ways to circumvent the security features of an application, system, or network. 
Penetration testing often involves issuing real attacks on real systems and data, using 
the same tools and techniques used by actual attackers. Most penetration tests involve 
looking for combinations of vulnerabilities on a single system or multiple systems that 
can be used to gain more access than could be achieved through a single vulnerability.

A group of individuals that conduct operational network vulnerability evaluations and 
provide mitigation techniques to customers who have a need for an independent 
technical review of their network security posture. The Blue Team identifies security 
threats and risks in the operating environment, and in cooperation with the customer, 
analyzes the network environment and its current state of security readiness. Based on 
the Blue Team findings and expertise, they provide recommendations that integrate into 
an overall community security solution to increase the customer's cybersecurity 
readiness posture. Often times a Blue Team is employed by itself or prior to a Red Team 
employment to ensure that the customer's networks are as secure as possible before 
having the Red Team test the systems. 
Ref: (CNSSI 4009-2015 )
Blue Team
A security operations center (SOC) is a specialized location (and team) where security-
related data from enterprise information systems (e.g., web sites, applications, 
databases, servers, networks, desktops and other devices) is monitored, assessed and 
actioned. The SOC is often dedicated to the detection, investigation and potential 
response to indicators of compromise. The SOC works closely with, and disseminates, 
collated security-related information to other areas of the organization (e.g., the cyber 
security function, incident management team and IT service owners).
SOC
Cyber kill chain 
Contractual concept used to structure a cyber-attack.
The group responsible for referring an engagement between a Red Team of mock 
attackers and a Blue Team of actual defenders of their enterprise’s use of information 
systems. In an exercise, the White Team acts as the judges, enforces the rules of the 
exercise, observes the exercise, scores teams, resolves any problems that may arise, 
handles all requests for information or questions, and ensures that the competition runs 
fairly and does not cause operational problems for the defender's mission. The White 
Team helps to establish the rules of engagement, the metrics for assessing results and 
the procedures for providing operational security for the engagement. The White Team 
normally has responsibility for deriving lessons-learned, conducting the post 
engagement assessment, and promulgating results.
